4,"It is likely that eventually it will become endemic, and most of us will get infected. But one question is super important: How long will it take for that to happen? If it happens in a few months, every hospital will be overwhelmed and people will not be treated for coronavirus or other diseases. If it happens that fast, it will be an unprecedented disaster. However, if we do our best in terms of prevention by practicing social distancing, reducing travel, not going to work when we’re sick, we could slow spread of the disease. If the same 60-70% infection of the global population is spread over 3 years, then hospitals don’t get overwhelmed, people can get treated, and we have time to develop a vaccine—it’s a completely different story.The difference between it happening fast or slow is potentially the difference between a 1918 flu level event and a bad flu season level event. We have control over that."

4,"Could the pandemic of the century have been averted? The process by which WHO decides whether to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations has drawn criticism. Reports have condemned the 4-month delay by WHO after the international spread of Ebola in west Africa before declaring a PHEIC.1 The Democratic Republic of the Congo, now experiencing the second largest Ebola outbreak in recorded history, notified WHO of the outbreak on Aug 1, 2018, but WHO required four Emergency Committee meetings, including on Oct 17, 2018 (216 confirmed cases, 139 deaths, and 64% case fatality ratio), and April 12 and June 14, 2019 (four confirmed cases in Uganda). Justifying their response, the Emergency Committee said that “the cluster of cases in Uganda is not unexpected”. A PHEIC was finally declared at the fourth Emergency Committee meeting on July 17, 2019 (2501 cases and 1668 deaths), almost a year after initial notification. The International Health Regulations do not require actual international spread, only a high potential for that spread, and thus the criteria for a PHEIC had already been met by the second Emergency Committee meeting.4 Notably, the PHEIC declaration coincided with increased resourcing and international focus, leading to a major reduction in Ebola cases.Global health scholars have criticised the Emergency Committee process as lacking transparency, using “irrelevant considerations, undue influence and political interference”, and delaying declaration when International Health Regulations criteria have been met.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak originating in China and reported to WHO on Dec 31, 2019, suggests that little has changed. The PHEIC declaration for COVID-19 occurred well after most public health experts had concluded that this outbreak posed a major international threat. At the first Emergency Committee meeting on Jan 22, 2020 (309 cases and six deaths reported in mainland China; five confirmed cases in four countries or territories), the Emergency Committee said it did not have key facts from China. It extended the meeting to the next day, when cases had risen to 571, with 17 deaths and ten cases in seven other countries or territories. Yet, the Emergency Committee could not achieve consensus, and the Director-General concluded that the outbreak was “an emergency in China, but it had not yet become a global health emergency”.Again, the process appeared “more political than technical”, as a Lancet Editorial described Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, adding that “the committee seems to have favoured local protectiveness over global galvanising”.7 By the time the Emergency Committee declared a PHEIC for COVID-19 on Jan 30, 2020, 7736 cases and 179 deaths had been confirmed in mainland China, with 107 cases confirmed in 21 other countries.Delays in declaring a PHEIC could have serious detrimental consequences, lulling governments and donors into a false sense of security, because they could reason that if WHO does not consider the situation an international emergency, then it does not require a surge response.The legal definition of a PHEIC is clear, as “an extraordinary event that may constitute a public health risk to other countries through international spread of disease and may require an international coordinated response.” The purpose of the declaration is to focus international attention on acute public health risks that “require coordinated mobilisation of extraordinary resources by the international community” for prevention and response.
The PHEIC process requires urgent reform. First, the all-or-nothing nature of the assessment generates confusion. We therefore propose a multilevel PHEIC process with each level defined by objective epidemiological criteria and paired with specific readiness actions. Level 1 PHEIC alert should indicate a high risk outbreak in a single country, with the potential for international spread requiring concerted public health efforts to contain and manage it locally. Level 2 PHEIC should imply that multiple countries have had importations and that limited spread has occurred in those countries. Level 3 PHEIC would indicate large clusters in multiple countries, with evidence of ongoing local transmission. This tiering would provide less ambiguous risk signalling, while also encouraging earlier, proportionate public health measures when they are most effective.Second, WHO should convene an expert consensus meeting to establish objective, evidence-based epidemiological and containment criteria to transparently guide its decision making processes. The draft algorithm under Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations8 (appendix) already includes critical elements, but there are also subjective considerations, such as restraints on international travel and trade. The algorithm contains perverse relative weightings, treating the five categories as equivalent.The clear purpose of a PHEIC declaration is to catalyse timely evidence-based action, to spur increased international funding and support, and to limit the public health and societal impacts of emerging and re-emerging disease risks. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, International Health Regulation reform must be an ethical imperative for more rapid and effective responses to novel infectious diseases."
4,"Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, is a new respiratory virus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. "
4,"Children, including very young children, can develop COVID-19. Many of them have no symptoms. Those that do get sick tend to experience milder symptoms such as low-grade fever, fatigue, and cough. Some children have had severe complications, but this has been less common. Children with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe illness.A complication that has more recently been observed in children can be severe and dangerous. Called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), it can lead to life-threatening problems with the heart and other organs in the body. Early reports compare it to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory illness that can lead to heart problems. But while some cases look very much like Kawasaki's, others have been different.Symptoms of MIS-C can include, fever lasting more than a couple of days, rash, conjunctivitis (redness of the white part of the eye), stomachache, vomiting and/or diarrhea, a large, swollen lymph node in the neck, red, cracked lips, a tongue that is redder than usual and looks like a strawberry, swollen hands and/or feet irritability and/or unusual sleepiness or weakness.Many conditions can cause these symptoms. Doctors make the diagnosis of MIS-C based on these symptoms, along with a physical examination and medical tests that check for inflammation and how organs are functioning. Call the doctor if your child develops symptoms, particularly if their fever lasts for more than a couple of days. If the symptoms get any worse or just don't improve, call again or bring your child to an emergency room.Doctors have had success using various treatments for inflammation, as well as treatments to support organ systems that are having trouble. While there have been some deaths, most children who have developed MIS-C have recovered."
4,"How fake news helped this strange (and utterly false) coronavirus myth spin out of control. As fear of the deadly coronavirus has gripped the globe, there has been one rather vocal section of the world, at least online, that’s reveling in their presumed safety from the dreaded disease. You see, over on Black Twitter, folks are boasting that Black people are naturally safe from infection because we have melanin… and also ginger ale.So, um, where did all these ill-founded health rumors start? And why would Black people possibly think that our melanin is like teflon from viral infection?For starters, if you check this interactive map from the New York Times that tracks the spread of the virus, you’ll notice a few areas that have no known infections. You’ll also notice that those same areas have something else in common: They’re places where people with lots of melanin live. You put one and one together, and boom, now you have the beginnings of a quasi-scientific opinion based on an obvious observation.But really, all it took was one fake news story from Valentine’s Day for the hoteps on Facebook and Twitter to flood their feeds with this wave of disinformation. That article, from a website called CityScrollz and which has since been deleted, was later repurposed and has reappeared in more professional-appearing posts, like this one, which features the gripping headline “Chinese Doctor Says African Skin Resists Coronavirus.” A second-wave clickbait news story was published on February 16th by the Zambian Observer. Until yesterday, I’d never heard of this news site, but whatever it is, its reporting on why melanin protects Black people from coronavirus isn’t just factually challenged, it’s a dangerous lie. For instance, consider the scientific acumen of this choice passage.“The Chinese doctors confirmed that Senou stayed alive because of his blood genetic composition which is mainly found in the genetic composition of subsaharan Africans. Chinese doctors also said that he remained alive because he has black skin, the antibodies of a black are three times stronger, powerful and resistant compared to that of a white.“Zanomoya Mditshwa, an African, shared his opinion saying black man is indestructible. ‘Caucasians is always at war with our black skin because they know our melanin is our defense against all that they throw at us. This proves yet again that the black man is indestructible, our bodies are made of the same substances that make up this Earth because we are owners of this universe they will never wipe us off, history has already proved that,’ he said.”While “news” stories like this are good for a laugh, like all ignorance, they also pose a serious health risk. And this rumor has been spreading online about as quickly as the virus has been bouncing across real-world borders.The wrongheaded notion of “melanated protection” has become so commonplace Snopes had to step in to debunk it. The Associated Press Fact Check also did its journalistic due diligence to disrupt the rumor’s spread. Meanwhile, the AFP spoke with Amadou Alpha Sall, the director of the Institut Pasteur in Senegal. The institute is a research center that’s been analyzing the infection profiles of possible patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. He attempted to clear the haze of confusion by saying, “There’s no scientific evidence to support this rumor. Ethnicity and genetics have no influence on recovery from the virus, and Black people don’t have more antibodies than white people.”There is one part of this story that’s real: Senou, the Cameroonian patient referred to. And how he was returned to full health after contracting coronavirus is the story that people should actually know — even if it’s not as funny.As the BBC originally reported, Senou is a 21-year-old student from Cameroon who lives and studies in Jingzhou, China. Having previously contracted malaria as a child, Senou was legit scared when he was convinced that he’d contracted the novel coronavirus. He told the BBC, “When I was going to the hospital for the first time, I was thinking about my death and how I thought it was going to happen.” For his treatment, Chinese doctors didn’t rely on his melanin to beat the virus, nor did they trust that his “black antibodies [were] three times stronger, powerful and resistant”; instead, they gave him antibiotics and drugs usually prescribed to patients battling HIV.Two weeks of medical attention later and Senou was declared to have fully recovered. His medical treatment was fully paid for by the Chinese government. This fact alone would appear to be far more important and integral to his recovery than any racialized strength of his antibodies.Then, late last week, there was even more news that should have upset the narrative that Black people’s melanin somehow makes us naturally immune to coronavirus. That is, the first patient in Sub-Saharan Africa was diagnosed after contracting the semi-deadly illness. The victim was reported in Nigeria. Except there’s a catch: The patient isn’t Black. According to the New York Times, he’s reportedly an Italian national who works in Nigeria. Not to mention, he’d just returned to the country from a trip to Milan, which means that there’s still no official cases of a Sub-Saharan African who has contracted coronavirus. 
Interestingly, another large geographic area filled with brown people of all shades — India — has also been largely immune to coronavirus, despite the fact that it borders China for 2,167 miles. But again, according to the Economic Times, this probably has more to do with the country’s supply chain (unlike its neighbors, India has been very reluctant to rely on Chinese commerce) than the color of its populace’s skin. After all, the Chinese epicenter of the viral outbreak is Wuhan, a heavily industrial city, whose products ship globally. But India isn’t buying much. If you consider how the virus has hit rural Iran, packaging of Chinese goods would make a lot of sense as a disease vector — and be far more productive to consider than “melanin protection.” Because in tough, ever-evolving cases like these, the answer is hardly ever skin-deep."
4,"With more than 4·2 million people infected and over 288 000 deaths as of May 12, 2020, COVID-19 is threatening the entire world, with dramatic consequences for global health and the economy. After the initial outbreaks in China and Italy, the virus rapidly spread worldwide and today the USA is one of the most affected country, with more than 1·3 million cases.In the absence of effective containment measures, COVID-19 outbreaks are characterised by an overwhelming number of patients requiring hospital admission, which could exceed the capacity even of well organised health-care systems.Current knowledge of the clinical course of severe forms of COVID-19 is mainly based on retrospective analyses of Chinese, Italian, and US case series.These studies show that critically ill patients with COVID-19 are mainly older, mostly men, and have at least one comorbidity (primarily hypertension), and mortality is very high (ranging from 56% to 97%) when invasive mechanical ventilation is required. However, limited data are available on factors independently associated with mortality. In The Lancet, Matthew Cummings and colleagues add to our knowledge by reporting the results of a prospective cohort study describing clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of 257 critically ill patients (87 [34%] women and 170 [66%] men, median age 62 years) admitted to high-dependency and intensive care units in two hospitals in New York City over a period of 4 weeks. Notably, critically ill patients with COVID-19 represented 22% of all patients admitted. Compared with other reports, in the cohort described by Cummings and colleagues the proportion of patients younger than 50 years of age was relatively high (55 [21%] of 257 patients). This could be explained by the high incidence of obesity, which affected 39 (71%) of those 55 younger patients. Other common comorbidities were hypertension (162 [63%]), diabetes (92 [36%]), chronic cardiovascular disease (49 [19%]), chronic kidney disease (37 [14%]), and chronic pulmonary disease (24 [9%]). 203 (79%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, median respiratory system compliance was low (26 mL/cm water), and all patients required a high fraction of inspired oxygen despite having relatively high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (median 15 cm water). Although obesity might have affected the mechanical properties of the respiratory system, these findings underline that the optimal management of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure remains poorly understood.The study by Cummings and colleagues10 confirms that COVID-19 is characterised by a high incidence of multiple organ dysfunction, as shown by the proportion of patients requiring vasopressors (170 [66%]) and renal replacement therapy (79 [31%]). Regarding pharmacological treatments, antibacterial agents were administered empirically to nearly all critically ill patients (229 [89%]) and hydroxychloroquine was administered to 185 (72%), while corticosteroids and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonists were administered to fewer patients (68 [26%] received corticosteroids and 44 [17%] received IL-6 receptor antagonists). No data are available on the temporal changes of inflammatory markers in patients receiving immunomodulating treatments. Furthermore, no information is provided about strategies of anticoagulant therapies, which are particularly interesting given the high incidence of thromboembolic complications associated with COVID-19.With regards to patient outcome, the study conveys important messages. In particular, it shows that the disease is characterised by a high mortality (101 [39%] after a minimum follow-up of 28 days) and prolonged clinical course, as shown by the high percentage of patients still in the hospital (94 [37%]) at the end of follow-up. The multivariable Cox model analysis showed that history of chronic pulmonary disease had the highest adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for mortality (aHR 2·94 [95% CI 1·48–5·84]). Other independent predictors of death were history of chronic cardiovascular disease (aHR 1·76 [95% CI 1·08–2·86]), older age (aHR 1·31 [95% CI 1·09–1·57]), higher concentrations of IL-6 (aHR 1·11 [95% CI 1·02–1·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer per decile increase on admission. There appear to be no differences by sex. The association of mortality with higher concentrations of IL-6 and D-dimer is particularly relevant for two reasons. First, it confirms the key pathogenic role played by the activation of systemic inflammation and endothelial-vascular damage in the development of organ dysfunction. Second, it provides the rationale for the design of clinical trials for measuring the efficacy of treatment with immunomodulating and anticoagulant drugs.The study by Cummings and colleagues shows that clinicians can produce high-quality research even when facing an overwhelming clinical workload. However, despite providing important insights, this work leaves us with some unanswered questions. While waiting for the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine, further studies are required to improve and personalise patient treatment, with particular attention to the role of initial non-invasive respiratory support strategies, timing of intubation, optimal setting of mechanical ventilation, and efficacy and safety of immunomodulating agents and anticoagulation strategies."
4,"Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus."
4,"A novel respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last December has spread to six continents. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, at least 20,000 people have died and the spread of the coronavirus was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March.

Much remains unknown about the virus, including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections, and whether they can transmit the virus. The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know.

Here’s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak.

What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract. At least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives.

Another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 caused a more dangerous condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The virus was contained after it had sickened 8,098 people and killed 774.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.

The new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19.

How dangerous is it?
It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.

About 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses.

Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected.Men are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection.

“This is a pattern we’ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract — men can have worse outcomes,” said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.How is the new coronavirus transmitted?
Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin.  
Bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans.The outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission.People infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air.Most respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way.

Scientists don’t know how long the new coronavirus can live on surfaces, and preliminary research suggests that hot and humid environments may not slow down the pathogen’s spread. Warm weather does tend to inhibit influenza and milder coronaviruses.

Infected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. That’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

When people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” he said. Still, a report by the World Health Organization suggests that asymptomatic cases are rare.What symptoms should I look out for?
Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.

Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus.If you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.

Is there a test for the virus? What is the treatment?
There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities.

In early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O.

The C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could, if a doctor approves the request. Private companies, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are also rushing to provide tests at various labs across the country, but the supply has yet to meet public demand. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested. Once a coronavirus infection is confirmed, the treatment is mainly supportive,  making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, managing his or her fever and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Patients with mild cases are told to rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said. Most people with mild infections recover in about two weeks. More than half of those who have been infected globally have already  recovered.A number of drugs are currently being tested as potential treatments, including  an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. The National Institutes of Health is testing the drug on infected patient in a clinical trial in Nebraska. The drug’s maker, Gilead, has also begun trials at various sites in Asia.How long will it take to develop a vaccine?
A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to act quickly, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.

After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.)

By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.

Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates.Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial might get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine was safe and effective.How can I protect myself?
The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance — at least six feet — from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.The risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States “is way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.

But, he added, “if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.”Should I cancel my international travel plans?
Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness.Is it too late to contain the virus?
W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province.

In recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning.But there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible.

Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was “concerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.”

“We’ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” he added.There is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and for local governments, companies and schools to enact strategies — telecommuting and online classes, for instance — that may reduce the spread.

But the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public.

“We have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries don’t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,” said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kong’s public health laboratory sciences division. “Not to mention something which is new to them. That’s a problem.”"
4,"We still don't fully understand how the new coronavirus spreads, but we're learning more every day.The new coronavirus has upended all of our usual calculus about seemingly ordinary activities. Is running past someone on the street safe? How about shopping in a grocery store with a 6-foot (2 meters) distance? And what about packages and takeout? And which of these activities poses the biggest risk?Unfortunately, there's a lot we still don't know about the way the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads.""At this point, I don't think anyone can take a group of people with COVID, say how each person has become infected, and then say that xx% got infected with droplets and yy% got infected via touching surfaces,"" Dr. Jeffrey N. Martin, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science in an email. ""I don't think this kind of study has ever been done for any infection. In most individual persons, we do not know how the person got infected.""Respiratory transmission. While the basic outlines of disease transmission have not been upended by COVID-19, there are some nuances that could play an important role in the spread of the disease. From the beginning, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have said that SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, and as such, it is mainly transmitted between people through ""respiratory droplets"" when symptomatic people sneeze or cough. This idea, that large droplets of virus-laden mucus are the primary mode of transmission, guides the CDC's advice to maintain at least a 6-foot distance between you and other people. The thinking is that gravity causes those large droplets (which are bigger than about .0002 inches, or 5 microns, in size) to fall to the ground within a distance of 6 feet from the infected person.
But that 6-foot guideline is more of a ballpark estimate than a hard and fast rule, said Josh Santarpia, the research director of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Program at the University of Nebraska's National Strategic Research Institute.""There really isn't anything magic about standing 6 feet away from someone that you are interacting with directly. If you stand talking to someone who is infected with the virus, whether it's 3 feet or 6 feet, there is going to be some risk of infection,"" Santarpia told Live Science in an email. That's because even large respiratory droplets can travel fairly far if the airflow conditions are right, Santarpia said.And some experts believe the 6-foot rule is based on outdated information.""6 feet is probably not safe enough. The 3-6 foot rule is based on a few studies from the 1930s and 1940s, which have since been shown to be wrong — droplets can travel farther than 6 feet,"" said Raina MacIntyre, a principal research fellow and professor of global biosecurity, who heads the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute, in Australia. ""Yet hospital infection control experts continue to believe this rule. It's like the flat Earth theory — anyone who tries to discuss the actual evidence is shouted down by a chorus of believers.”Another complicating factor is that at least 25% of the people who are transmitting the virus may be asymptomatic at the time, said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Live Science previously reported. That suggests coughs and sneezes aren't necessary to transmit the virus, though it's not clear whether simply breathing spreads the virus, or whether talking is required.Aerosol transmission
In order for the virus to be spread without being coughed or sneezed in large drops of mucus, it has to somehow be able to suspend in the air for long enough to infect passersby. And that’s another complicating factor in figuring out transmission: People emit virus particles in a range of sizes, and some are small enough to be considered aerosols, or fine particles that can stay suspended in the air for hours and can travel with air currents across tens of feet. A study published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that virus particles that were aerosolized could remain viable for up to 3 hours.What's not clear from this data is whether the virus is commonly transmitted via aerosols, or how long the virus remains infectious in aerosols in real-world settings. In that study, researchers used an extremely high concentration of virus particles, which may not reflect those shed by people with the disease.
""To my knowledge, there is no definitive evidence of transmission where aerosol was the only possible route,"" Santarpia told Live Science. For instance, even someone who's not sneezing may emit respiratory droplets when talking, because people may spit when talking, and those droplets could be deposited on surfaces.One case study is suggestive however; a choir group in Skagit, Washington, met for a two-hour practice in early March. No one was symptomatic, so singers weren’t coughing or sneezing out infected droplets. And everyone kept their distance. But when all was said and done, 45 people became infected with COVID-19 and at least two people died from the virus, the Los Angeles Times reported. That suggested the viral particles were shed as aerosols by someone, before being inhaled or otherwise acquired by other choir members. A 2019 study in the journal Nature Scientific Reports found that people emit more aerosol particles when talking, and that louder speech volumes correlate to more aerosol particles being emitted. Fight against online child sexual abuse this National Children’s Day with the National Crime.That case, along with those studies, suggest that the virus can be routinely transmitted via aerosols, though other routes of transmission (such as large droplets being emitted during singing or speech) are still possible explanations. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, aerosol transmission occurred during hospital procedures that generated large volumes of aerosols, such as intubation. Contact transmission.There's one other route that's thought to play a role in the spread of COVID-19: contact transmission. In that situation, viral particles emitted from the respiratory tract of an infected individual land on a surface. Then, another person touches that object, then touches their nose, mouth or eyes. The virus then sneaks into the body via the mucous membranes, infecting the second person. So far, no one knows how common this mode of transmission is, but it does seem to be possible. One study found that SARS-CoV-2 could remain viable on surfaces such as cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for 2 to 3 days. Santarpia has studied viral surface contamination in the context of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. In that study, which was published March 26 on the preprint database medRxiv, Santarpia and his colleagues found viral contamination in air samples, on surfaces such as toilets, and on frequently touched surfaces. Also on March 26, the CDC published a report on the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship. An investigative team found traces of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces throughout the cruise ship, in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers, up to 17 days later — though no evidence suggests this viral RNA was still infectious. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, meaning its main genetic material is RNA, not DNA. Another case report published by the CDC — this time from Singapore — also suggests contact with contaminated surfaces can transmit the virus. In that case, a person who was infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not yet symptomatic, attended a church service. Later in the day, another person sat in the same seat, and also came down with COVID-19. Whether the virus was contracted via a contaminated surface, or potentially a lingering aerosol, however, couldn't be ascertained.
Is food safe?So far, there's no evidence that the virus is transmitted via food. The virus will not live long in food proper, and while it's possible that food packaging from groceries or takeout could contain small concentrations of virus particles, it is easy to mitigate this risk by washing your hands after handling groceries or takeout,Ben Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University, previously told Live Science.Related: How to shop for groceries during the COVID-19 pandemic.The takeaway?The fact that so many seemingly innocuous activities can transmit the virus can be scary. And it can be even scarier not knowing the actual risks associated with each transmission route — without that information, how can we take the right steps to protect ourselves?But ultimately, there's some reassurance in the data as well.""What is true is that persons who have a member of their household infected with the virus have a higher probability of getting infected with COVID than people who do not have a member of their household infected. This tells us a lot. This tells us that close contact is the most important factor,"" Martin said.Briefly passing a person on the street, at a distance of 6 feet, is likely to pose a low risk of infection, Martin said. Chatting at a distance of 6 feet with that same person for a few hours will be higher risk, he said. Ultimately, social distancing is a powerful tool to cut all the hypothesized routes of transmission, experts said.""If the other person is shedding virus into the air, the longer you stand near them, the greater the chance you have to be exposed to the virus,"" Linsey Marr, who studies the transport of air pollutants in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech, told Live Science."
4,"A vaccine would be the ultimate weapon against the coronavirus and the best route back to normal life. Officials like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the top infectious disease expert on the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, estimate a vaccine could arrive in at least 12 to 18 months.The grim truth behind this rosy forecast is that a vaccine probably won’t arrive any time soon. Clinical trials almost never succeed. We’ve never released a coronavirus vaccine for humans before. Our record for developing an entirely new vaccine is at least four years — more time than the public or the economy can tolerate social-distancing orders.But if there was any time to fast-track a vaccine, it is now. So Times Opinion asked vaccine experts how we could condense the timeline and get a vaccine in the next few months instead of years.Here’s how we might achieve the impossible.Assume We Already Understand the Coronavirus. Normally, researchers need years to secure funding, get approvals and study results piece by piece. But these are not normal times.There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored.“If you want to make that 18-month timeframe, one way to do that is put as many horses in the race as you can,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.Companies with vaccine trials underway.Dozens of vaccines are starting clinical trials. Many use experimental RNA and DNA technology, which provides the body with instructions to produce its own antibodies against the virus.Despite the unprecedented push for a vaccine, researchers caution that less than 10 percent of drugs that enter clinical trials are ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration.The rest fail in one way or another: They are not effective, don’t perform better than existing drugs or have too many side effects.Less than 10 percent of drug trials are ultimately approved.Probability of success at each phase of research, Fortunately, we already have a head start on the first phase of vaccine development: research. The outbreaks of SARS and MERS, which are also caused by coronaviruses, spurred lots of research. SARS and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, are roughly 80 percent identical, and both use so-called spike proteins to grab onto a specific receptor found on cells in human lungs. This helps explain how scientists developed a test for Covid-19 so quickly.There’s a cost to moving so quickly, however. The potential Covid-19 vaccines now in the pipeline might be more likely to fail because of the swift march through the research phase, said Robert van Exan, a cell biologist who has worked in the vaccine industry for decades. He predicts we won’t see a vaccine approved until at least 2021 or 2022, and even then, “this is very optimistic and of relatively low probability.”And yet, he said, this kind of fast-tracking is “worth the try — maybe we will get lucky.”Years and years, at minimum.The vaccine development process has typically taken a decade or longer.The next step in the process is pre-clinical and preparation work, where a pilot factory is readied to produce enough vaccine for trials. Researchers relying on groundwork from the SARS and MERS outbreaks could theoretically move through planning steps swiftly.Sanofi, a French biopharmaceutical company, expects to begin clinical trials late this year for a Covid-19 vaccine that it repurposed from work on a SARS vaccine. If successful, the vaccine could be ready by late 2021.Move at ‘Pandemic Speed’ Through Trials, As a rule, researchers don’t begin jabbing people with experimental vaccines until after rigorous safety checks.They test the vaccine first on small batches of people — a few dozen during Phase 1, then a few hundred in Phase 2, then thousands in Phase 3. Months normally pass between phases so that researchers can review the findings and get approvals for subsequent phases.But “if we do it the conventional way, there’s no way we’re going to be reaching that timeline of 18 months,” said Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at Yale University School of Medicine and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.There are ways to slash time off this process by combining several phases and testing vaccines on more people without as much waiting.Last week the National Academy of Sciences showed an overlapping timeline, describing it as moving at “pandemic speed.”It’s here that talk of fast-tracking the timeline meets the messiness of real life: What if a promising vaccine actually makes it easier to catch the virus, or makes the disease worse after someone’s infected?That’s been the case for a few H.I.V. drugs and vaccines for dengue fever, because of a process called vaccine-induced enhancement, in which the body reacts unexpectedly and makes the disease more dangerous.Researchers can’t easily infect vaccinated participants with the coronavirus to see how the body behaves. They normally wait until some volunteers contract the virus naturally. That means dosing people in regions hit hardest by the virus, like New York, or vaccinating family members of an infected person to see if they get the virus next. If the pandemic subsides, this step could be slowed.“That’s why vaccines take such a long time,” said Dr. Iwasaki. “But we’re making everything very short. Hopefully we can evaluate these risks as they occur, as soon as possible.”This is where the vaccine timelines start to diverge depending on who you are, and where some people might get left behind.If a vaccine proves successful in early trials, regulators could issue an emergency-use provision so that doctors, nurses and other essential workers could get vaccinated right away — even before the end of the year. Researchers at Oxford announced this week that their coronavirus vaccine could be ready for emergency use by September if trials prove successful.So researchers might produce a viable vaccine in just 12 to 18 months, but that doesn’t mean you’re going to get it. Millions of people could be in line before you. And that’s only if the United States finds a vaccine first. If another country, like China, beats us to it, we could wait even longer while it doses its citizens first.
You might be glad of that, though, if it turned out that the fast-tracked vaccine caused unexpected problems. Only after hundreds or thousands are vaccinated would researchers be able to see if a fast-tracked vaccine led to problems like vaccine-induced enhancement.“It’s true that any new technology comes with a learning curve,” said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “And sometimes that learning curve has a human price.”Start Preparing Factories Now. Once we have a working vaccine in hand, companies will need to start producing millions — perhaps billions — of doses, in addition to the millions of vaccine doses that are already made each year for mumps, measles and other illnesses. It’s an undertaking almost unimaginable in scope.
Companies normally build new facilities perfectly tailored to any given vaccine because each vaccine requires different equipment. Some flu vaccines are produced using chicken eggs, using large facilities where a version of the virus is incubated and harvested. Other vaccines require vats in which a virus is cultured in a broth of animal cells and later inactivated and purified.Those factories follow strict guidelines governing biological facilities and usually take around five years to build, costing at least three times more than conventional pharmaceutical factories. Manufacturers may be able to speed this up by creating or repurposing existing facilities in the middle of clinical trials, long before the vaccine in question receives F.D.A. approval.“They just can’t wait,” said Dr. Iwasaki. “If it turns out to be a terrible vaccine, they won’t distribute it. But at least they’ll have the capability” to do so if the vaccine is successful.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says it will build factories for seven different vaccines. “Even though we’ll end up picking at most two of them, we’re going to fund factories for all seven, just so that we don’t waste time,” Bill Gates said during an appearance on “The Daily Show.”In the end, the United States will have the capacity to mass-produce only two or three vaccines, said Vijay Samant, the former head of vaccine manufacturing at Merck.“The manufacturing task is insurmountable,” Mr. Samant said. “I get sleepless nights thinking about it.”Consider just one seemingly simple step: putting the vaccine into vials. Manufacturers need to procure billions of vials, and billions of stoppers to seal them. Sophisticated machines are needed to fill them precisely, and each vial is inspected on a high-speed line. Then vials are stored, shipped and released to the public using a chain of temperature-controlled facilities and trucks. At each of these stages, producers are already stretched to meet existing demands, Mr. Samant said.
It’s a bottleneck similar to the one that caused a dearth of ventilators, masks and other personal protective equipment just as Covid-19 surged across America.
If you talk about vaccines long enough, a new type of vaccine, called Messenger RNA (or mRNA for short), inevitably comes up. There are hopes it could be manufactured at a record clip. Mr. Gates even included it on his Time magazine list of six innovations that could change the world. Is it the miracle we’re waiting for?Rather than injecting subjects with disease-specific antigens to stimulate antibody production, mRNA vaccines give the body instructions to create those antigens itself. Because mRNA vaccines don’t need to be cultured in large quantities and then purified, they are much faster to produce. They could change the course of the fight against Covid-19.“On the other hand,” said Dr. van Exan, “no one has ever made an RNA vaccine for humans.”Researchers conducting dozens of trials hope to change that, including one by the pharmaceutical company Moderna. Backed by investor capital and spurred by federal funding of up to $483 million to tackle Covid-19, Moderna has already fast-tracked an mRNA vaccine. It’s entering Phase 1 trials this year and the company says it could have a vaccine ready for front-line workers later this year.“Could it work? Yeah, it could work,” said Dr. Fred Ledley, a professor of natural biology and applied sciences at Bentley University. “But in terms of the probability of success, what our data says is that there’s a lower chance of approval and the trials take longer.”The technology is decades old, yet mRNA is not very stable and can break down inside the body.“At this point, I’m hoping for anything to work,” said Dr. Iwasaki. “If it does work, wonderful, that’s great. We just don’t know.”The fixation on mRNA shows the allure of new and untested treatments during a medical crisis. Faced with the unsatisfying reality that our standard arsenal takes years to progress, the mRNA vaccine offers an enticing story mixed with hope and a hint of mystery. But it’s riskier than other established approaches.
Speed Up Regulatory Approvals, Imagine that the fateful day arrives. Scientists have created a successful vaccine. They’ve manufactured huge quantities of it. People are dying. The economy is crumbling. It’s time to start injecting people.But first, the federal government wants to take a peek.That might seem like a bureaucratic nightmare, a rubber stamp that could cost lives. There’s even a common gripe among researchers: For every scientist employed by the F.D.A., there are three lawyers. And all they care about is liability.Yet F.D.A. approvals are no mere formality. Approvals typically take a full year, during which time scientists and advisory committees review the studies to make sure that the vaccine is as safe and effective as drug makers say it is.While some steps in the vaccine timeline can be fast-tracked or skipped entirely, approvals aren’t one of them. There are horror stories from the past where vaccines were not properly tested. In the 1950s, for example, a poorly produced batch of a polio vaccine was approved in a few hours. It contained a version of the virus that wasn’t quite dead, so patients who got it actually contracted polio. Several children died.The same scenario playing out today could be devastating for Covid-19, with the anti-vaccination movement and online conspiracy theorists eager to disrupt the public health response. So while the F.D.A. might do this as fast as possible, expect months to pass before any vaccine gets a green light for mass public use.
At this point you might be asking: Why are all these research teams announcing such optimistic forecasts when so many experts are skeptical about even an 18-month timeline? Perhaps because it’s not just the public listening — it’s investors, too.“These biotechs are putting out all these press announcements,” said Dr. Hotez. “You just need to recognize they’re writing this for their shareholders, not for the purposes of public health.”What if It Takes Even Longer Than the Pessimists Predict?Covid-19 lives in the shadow of the most vexing virus we’ve ever faced: H.I.V. After nearly 40 years of work, here is what we have to show for our vaccine efforts: a few Phase 3 clinical trials, one of which actually made the disease worse, and another with a success rate of just 30 percent.Deaths per year.The number of deaths from Covid-19 in 2020 has surpassed the number of deaths per year from H.I.V./AIDS during the height of the crisis in the 1990s.Researchers say they don’t expect a successful H.I.V. vaccine until 2030 or later, putting the timeline at around 50 years.That’s unlikely to be the case for Covid-19, because, as opposed to H.I.V., it doesn’t appear to mutate significantly and exists within a family of familiar respiratory viruses. Even still, any delay will be difficult to bear.But the history of H.I.V. offers a glimmer of hope for how life could continue even without a vaccine. Researchers developed a litany of antiviral drugs that lowered the death rate and improved health outcomes for people living with AIDS. Today’s drugs can lower the viral load in an H.I.V.-positive person so the virus can’t be transmitted through sex.Therapeutic drugs, rather than vaccines, might likewise change the fight against Covid-19. The World Health Organization began a global search for drugs to treat Covid-19 patients in March. If successful, those drugs could lower the number of hospital admissions and help people recover faster from home while narrowing the infection window so fewer people catch the virus.Combine that with rigorous testing and contact tracing — where infected patients are identified and their recent contacts notified and quarantined — and the future starts looking a little brighter. So far, the United States is conducting fewer than half the number of tests required and we need to recruit more than 300,000 contact-tracers. But other countries have started reopening following exactly these steps.If all those things come together, life might return to normal long before a vaccine is ready to shoot into your arm."
4,"When people recover from COVID-19, their blood contains antibodies that their bodies produced to fight the coronavirus and help them get well. Antibodies are found in plasma, a component of blood.Convalescent plasma — literally plasma from recovered patients — has been used for more than 100 years to treat a variety of illnesses from measles to polio, chickenpox, and SARS. In the current situation, antibody-containing plasma from a recovered patient is given by transfusion to a patient who is suffering from COVID-19. The donor antibodies help the patient fight the illness, possibly shortening the length or reducing the severity of the disease.Though convalescent plasma has been used for many years, and with varying success, not much is known about how effective it is for treating COVID-19. There have been reports of success from China, but no randomized, controlled studies (the gold standard for research studies) have been done. Experts also don't yet know the best time during the course of the illness to give plasma.On March 24th, the FDA began allowing convalescent plasma to be used in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections. This treatment is still considered experimental."
4,"It's thought that people can have the virus for up to 14 days without having any symptoms.This time before symptoms develop is called the incubation period.Most people who catch COVID-19 will have an illness like a bad cold or flu. Some people will have a more severe illness, like pneumonia.You’re more likely to have a severe illness if: you are older, you live in a nursing home or care home, you are male, you are obese, you are a smoker, you have high blood pressure, you have diabetes, you have cardiovascular disease (a condition affecting your heart or your blood vessels,e.g. heart attack, stroke, heart failure, angina), you have a disease affecting your lungs (e.g. asthma, COPD). you have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, you have cancer, you have had an organ transplant, you are recovering from surgery. Children seem to be infected with corona virus less frequently than adults. Most children who catch COVID-19 have had close contact with an infected person.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are: fever, coughing, shortness of breath, loss of sense of smell, and reduced sense of taste,Less common symptoms can include: aches and pains, feeling tired, diarrhoea, feeling nauseous or vomiting, abdominal (tummy) pain, loss of appetite, coughing up a lot of phlegm, sore throat, confusion, dizziness, blocked or runny nose, conjunctivitis (red or watery eyes), headache, skin rashes, and coughing up blood.COVID-19 can also cause sepsis. This is when the body’s immune system reacts badly to an infection and attacks the body. It affects about 5 in 100 people with COVID-19. The symptoms of sepsis include: fever, a fast heartbeat, confusion not needing to urinate as much as usual, and mottled, patchy skin. There have been reports of COVID-19 causing a severe illness in children, with a fever lasting more than five days, a rash, swollen glands in the neck, red fingers or toes and dry, cracked lips. This is very rare but if you have concerns about your child, it’s very important to speak to a doctor as soon as possible. As you can see, many of the less serious symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of a bad cold or flu. So it can be hard to diagnose COVID-19 without testing. If your doctor thinks that you might have COVID-19, you might need some tests, such as collecting a sample from your nose or mouth, blood tests, a chest x-ray, or another type of scan of your chest called a CT (computed tomography) scan.Some people who are seriously ill with COVID-19 can develop problems with their kidneys,liver, heart or brain. If this happens, you might need more tests and extra care.Pregnant and breastfeeding women. We don't know for certain whether the virus can pass from a mother who is infected to her baby in the womb, or to a baby through breastfeeding. The symptoms of COVID-19 during pregnancy are the same as in people who are not pregnant. If you are pregnant and you develop symptoms, you should contact your doctor straight away. You might need regular ultrasound scans during your pregnancy if you have had COVID-19. And you and your baby might need extra monitoring during labour and after giving birth.Some countries, such as the UK, recommend that pregnant women should follow strict social distancing measures"
4,"Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from 2019-nCoV"
4,"Travellers should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously. Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider."
4,"This is about the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak that began in China in late 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a pandemic. This means that it has spread across the world. This virus can cause a severe lung infection, and it can cause death. You can use our information to talk with your doctor if you are concerned about COVID-19."
4,"According to a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can live in the air and on surfaces between several hours and several days. The study found that the virus is viable for up to 72 hours on plastics, 48 hours on stainless steel, 24 hours on cardboard, and 4 hours on copper. It is also detectable in the air for three hours.Volkin: According to this report, it sounds like the COVID-19 virus is potentially living on surfaces for days. How worried should we be about our risk of becoming infected simply by touching something an infected person was in contact with days ago?
Machamer: What's getting a lot of press and is presented out of context is that the virus can last on plastic for 72 hours—which sounds really scary. But what's more important is the amount of the virus that remains. It's less than 0.1% of the starting virus material. Infection is theoretically possible but unlikely at the levels remaining after a few days. People need to know this.While the New England Journal of Medicine study found that the COVID virus can be detected in the air for 3 hours, in nature, respiratory droplets sink to the ground faster than the aerosols produced in this study. The experimental aerosols used in labs are smaller than what comes out of a cough or sneeze, so they remain in the air at face-level longer than heavier particles would in nature.What is the best way I can protect myself, knowing that the virus that causes COVID-19 lives on surfaces?You are more likely to catch the infection through the air if you are next to someone infected than off of a surface. Cleaning surfaces with disinfectant or soap is very effective because once the oily surface coat of the virus is disabled, there is no way the virus can infect a host cell. However, there cannot be an overabundance of caution. Nothing like this has ever happened before.The CDC guidelines on how to protect yourself include:Clean and disinfect surfaces that many people come in contact with. These include tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Avoid touching high-contact surfaces in public.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately when you return home from a public place such as the bank or grocery store.
When in a public space, put a distance of six feet between yourself and others.Most importantly, stay home if you are sick and contact your doctor.
There has been speculation that once the summer season arrives and the weather warms up, the virus won't survive, but we don't yet know if that is true. Does the weather or indoor temperature affect the survival of the COVID-19 virus on surfaces?There is no evidence one way or the other. The virus's viability in exposure to heat or cold has not been studied. But it does bear pointing out that the New England Journal of Medicine study was performed at about room temperature, 21-23 degrees Celsius.How does the virus that causes COVID-19 compare with other coronaviruses, and why are we seeing so many more cases?
SARS-CoV-2 behaves like a typical respiratory coronavirus in the basic mechanisms of infection and replication. But several mutations allow it to bind tighter to its host receptor and increase its transmissibility, which is thought to make it more infectious.The New England Journal of Medicine study suggests that the stability of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV1, the virus that caused the 2002-2003 SARS global outbreak. But, researchers believe people can carry high viral loads of the SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract without recognizing any symptoms, allowing them to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic."
4,"For many people living with the crushing consequences of Covid-19, the summer offers a tantalizing possibility: If the coronavirus behaves like the seasonal flu, warm weather could substantially weaken the virus and allow normal life to resume. President Trump predicted exactly this outcome in February, claiming the virus would “miraculously” go away by April as temperatures rose.A new working paper tries to put that speculation to rest by tracking how weather and other environmental conditions, such as pollution, affect the virus’s spread around the world.The forecast from researchers is grim: Warm weather alone will not control the virus in America or abroad. Here are the results for the United States, showing weather on its own cannot meaningfully reduce infections to the rate of 1 new case per every infected person, the point by which the number of infections falls continuously.Without social distancing and other interventions, summer will offer only a modest respite in some places, meaning stay-at-home orders and other government interventions will most likely need to continue throughout the summer.“At the end of the day, this whole effect from weather and pollution is still pretty minor,” said Mohammad Jalali, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and one of the study’s authors. “No government should rely on the effect of the weather.”The study, conducted by researchers at six academic institutions, found that warm weather could play a small role in slowing the virus in at least a few places and for a few months. In some of the hottest cities in the United States, like Phoenix, high temperatures could drive down the rate of infections by over 40 percent. In parts of India and Pakistan, conditions during the hotter months could make the virus less than half as likely to infect new hosts.
For regions facing cold, bitter winters, weather has the opposite effect, increasing the rate of infections and making it even harder to control the virus.
Like all weather forecasts, there is significant uncertainty about the results. Researchers will continue to debate the measurements and methodology; others may come up with alternative projections. But all the evidence available suggests weather plays a role with coronavirus transmission, but only a small one.
Here is how those predictions look in every U.S. county for the next year.In New York City, weather could reduce the rate of infections by a quarter during the hottest months. But by winter, those benefits likewise fade, when cold weather could boost transmissions slightly.Headed into summer, governors have already signaled their eagerness to give up social distancing and reopen their economies before passing the White House’s own guidelines for testing and new infections. The warm weather effects could help justify those decisions in the short term, as governors point to falling infections as a sign that the virus is defeated.“Basing policy decisions on the assumption of seasonality is dangerous,” said Anice Lowen, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University, which was not affiliated with this study. “Possibly we’ll see slower spread in the summer, but even that summer spread could seed the virus in a quiet way, and then come winter it would be a bigger problem than it would have been.”There are some silver linings, however. Rather than relying on weather alone to slow the spread, it’s possible that warm temperatures will work alongside other interventions to adequately slow the virus. Here’s how that works:It’s not fully understood how warm weather controls the spread of the virus.
Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who wasn’t affiliated with this study, said that people are more susceptible to infections in other respiratory viruses when the air they breathe is cold or particularly dry.Research has also shown that the hotter it is, the faster some viruses will break down outside of a human host. Scientists have found evidence that this coronavirus dies in warmer weather as well. And dry air helps respiratory viruses in droplets expelled from a person’s nose or mouth stay in the air longer, making them more likely to infect someone else.Some differences may be driven by how people react to the weather. Regions with more ultraviolet light, like Colombia and Ecuador, were associated with higher transmission rates in the study, even though it’s believed that ultraviolet light can destroy the virus. Hazhir Rahmandad, a co-author of the study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggested a high UV index could drive people indoors, where it’s easier to spread the virus.“It’s a combination of host susceptibility and viral stability,” Dr. Iwasaki said. “In dry and colder conditions the virus survives better, combined with the fact that host resistance in those conditions is impaired.”As it becomes harder for the virus to find new people to infect, it’s likely that Covid-19 will ebb and flow with the seasons, according to Dr. Lowen, the Emory microbiology professor. But for now, too many are susceptible to the virus for the weather to influence when and where infections will rise and fall.
What has undoubtedly influenced the virus’s spread, however, is the human factor: decisions made by governments and individuals alike. While the weather effects are slight, some countries have successfully controlled the virus.The weather can’t be controlled. But our actions can."

WHO is working 24/7 to analyse data, provide advice, coordinate with partners, help countries prepare, increase supplies and manage expert networks.

4,"Scientists are developing more than 100 coronavirus vaccines using a range of techniques, some of which are well-established and some of which have never been approved for medical use before.Most of these vaccines target the so-called spike proteins that cover the virus and help it invade human cells. The immune system can develop antibodies that latch onto spike proteins and stop the virus.A successful vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus would teach people’s immune systems to make antibodies against the virus without causing disease.Whole-Virus Vaccines.Vaccines that modify the entire coronavirus to provoke an immune response.Inactivated and Live Attenuated Vaccines.Most vaccines in use today incorporate an inactivated or weakened form of a virus that is not able to cause disease. When immune cells encounter them, they make antibodies.Making these vaccines means growing viruses — and lots of them. Influenza vaccines are typically grown in chicken eggs, and other vaccines are grown in tanks full of floating cells. These procedures can take months to produce a batch of new vaccines.EXAMPLES: Conventional vaccines for influenza, chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella all fall into this category.COMPANIES DEVELOPING SARS-COV-2 VACCINES: Sinovac and others.Genetic Vaccines.Vaccines that use part of the coronavirus’s genetic code.DNA Vaccines.A number of experimental coronavirus vaccines don’t deliver whole viruses. Instead, they deliver genetic instructions for building a viral protein. The protein can then stimulate the immune system to make antibodies and help mount other defenses against the coronavirus.One of these genetic approaches is known as a DNA vaccine. A circle of engineered DNA is delivered into cells. The cells read the viral gene, make a copy in a molecule called messenger RNA, and then use the mRNA to assemble viral proteins. The immune system detects the proteins and mounts defenses.Prototype DNA vaccines based on the spike protein protected monkeys from the coronavirus.EXAMPLES: DNA vaccines have been approved for veterinary cases such as canine melanoma and West Nile virus in horses. There are no approved DNA vaccines for use in humans, but researchers are running trials to see if they might be effective for diseases such as Zika and the flu.COMPANIES: Inovio and others.RNA Vaccines. Some researchers want to skip DNA and instead deliver messenger RNA into cells. The cells read the mRNA and make spike proteins that provoke an immune response.The biotech company Moderna recently completed a small safety trial with eight volunteers that showed promising early results against the coronavirus.
Both RNA and DNA vaccines can be produced more quickly than traditional methods.EXAMPLES: There are no approved RNA vaccines, but they are in clinical trials for MERS and other diseases.Viral Vector Vaccines. Vaccines that use a virus to deliver coronavirus genes into cells.Vaccines Using Adenovirus or Other Viruses
Viruses are very good at getting into cells. Since the 1990s, researchers have been investigating how to use them to deliver genes into cells to immunize people against diseases.To create a coronavirus vaccine, several teams have added the spike protein gene to a virus called an adenovirus. The adenovirus slips into cells and unloads the gene. Because the adenovirus is missing one of its own genes, it cannot replicate and is therefore safe.EXAMPLES: Several virus vector vaccines are used to vaccinate animals against rabies and distemper. Johnson & Johnson has developed H.I.V. and Ebola vaccines using an adenovirus. Both have proven safe in humans and are now in efficacy trials.Protein-Based Vaccines.Vaccines that use a coronavirus protein or a protein fragment.Virus-Like Particle Vaccines.Some vaccines are particles that contain pieces of viral proteins. They can’t cause disease because they are not actual viruses, but they can still show the immune system what coronavirus proteins look like.EXAMPLES: The vaccine for HPV falls into this category.COMPANIES: Medicago, Doherty Institute and others.Recombinant Vaccines.Yeast or other cells can be engineered to carry a virus’s gene and spew out viral proteins, which are then harvested and put into a vaccine. A coronavirus vaccine of this design would contain whole spike proteins or small pieces of the protein.EXAMPLES: This category includes some vaccines for shingles and hepatitis B.COMPANIES: Novavax and others."
4,"The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In addition, any infected person, with or without symptoms, could spread the virus by touching a surface. The coronavirus could remain on that surface and someone else could touch it and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That's why it's so important to try to avoid touching public surfaces or at least try to wipe them with a disinfectant.Social distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce social distancing at a community level.Slowing down the rate and number of new coronavirus infections is critical to reduce the risk that large numbers of critically ill patients cannot receive life-saving care. Highly realistic projections show that unless we begin extreme social distancing now — every day matters — our hospitals and other healthcare facilities will not be able to handle the likely influx of patients."
4,"The numbers are changing rapidly.The most up-to-date information is available from the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Johns Hopkins University.It has spread so rapidly and to so many countries that the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic (a term indicating that it has affected a large population, region, country, or continent)."
4,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.
Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.  However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic."
4,"The answer depends on whether you're looking at the fatality rate (the risk of death among those who are infected) or the total number of deaths. So far, influenza has caused far more total deaths this flu season, both in the US and worldwide, than COVID-19. This is why you may have heard it said that the flu is a bigger threat.Regarding the fatality rate, it appears that the risk of death with the pandemic coronavirus infection (commonly estimated at about 1%) is far less than it was for SARS (approximately 11%) and MERS (about 35%), but will likely be higher than the risk from seasonal flu (which averages about 0.1%). We will have a more accurate estimate of fatality rate for this coronavirus infection once testing becomes more available.What we do know so far is the risk of death very much depends on your age and your overall health. Children appear to be at very low risk of severe disease and death. Older adults and those who smoke or have chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or lung disease have a higher chance of developing complications like pneumonia, which could be deadly."

How to discontinue home isolation.People with COVID-19 who have stayed home (home isolated) can leave home under the following conditions.If you have not had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after these three things have happened: You have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use of medicine that reduces fevers) AND other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND at least 10 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared. If you have had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after these three things have happened: You no longer have a fever (without the use of medicine that reduces fevers) AND other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND you received two negative tests in a row, at least 24 hours apart. Your doctor will follow CDC guidelines.People who DID NOT have COVID-19 symptoms, but tested positive and have stayed home (home isolated) can leave home under the following conditions.
If you have not had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after these two things have happened:
At least 10 days have passed since the date of your first positive test. AND you continue to have no symptoms (no cough or shortness of breath) since the test.If you have had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after:You received two negative tests in a row, at least 24 hours apart. Your doctor will follow CDC guidelines.Note: if you develop symptoms, follow guidance above for people with COVID19 symptoms.In all cases, follow the guidance of your doctor and local health department. The decision to stop home isolation should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider and state and local health departments. Some people, for example those with conditions that weaken their immune system, might continue to shed virus even after they recover.Find more information on when to end home isolation."
4,"Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms."
4,"Hot peppers in your food, though very tasty, cannot prevent or cure COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is to keep at least 1 metre away from others and to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. It is also beneficial for your general health to maintain a balanced diet, stay well hydrated, exercise regularly and sleep well."
4,"Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are known to infect both humans and animals, and in humans cause respiratory illness that range from common colds to much more serious infections. The most well-known case of a coronavirus epidemic was Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), which, after first being detected in southern China in 2002, went on to affect 26 countries and resulted in more than 8,000 cases and 774 deaths.While the cause of the current outbreak was initially unknown, on January 7 Chinese health authorities identified that it was caused by to a strain of coronavirus that hadn’t been encountered in humans before. Five days later the Chinese government shared the genetic sequence of the virus so that other countries could develop their own diagnostic kits. That virus is now called Sars-CoV-2.Although symptoms of coronaviruses are often mild – the most common symptoms are a fever and dry cough – in some cases they lead to more serious respiratory tract illness including pneumonia and bronchitis. These can be particularly dangerous in older patients, or people who have existing health conditions, and this appears to be the case with Covid-19. A study of 44,415 early Chinese Covid-19 patients found that 81 per cent of people with confirmed infections experienced only mild symptoms. Of the remaining cases, 14 per cent were in a severe condition while five per cent of people were critical cases, suffering from respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure. In the Chinese study, 2.3 per cent of all confirmed cases died, although the actual death rate is probably much lower as many more people will have been infected with the virus than tested positive."

4,"The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.
For most, the disease is mild, but some people die.So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?Incubation period.This is when the virus is establishing itself.Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells.At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms.The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.Mild disease.This is all most people will experience.Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough.Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus.
Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.Severe disease.If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body.""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.Critical disease.It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage.
Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.The first deaths.Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs.The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.He died 11 days after he was admitted.The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.
"
2," Is 5G to partially blame for coronavirus deaths? Can 5G cause the blood that’s circulating in your body to be unable to carry oxygen?What’s especially horrifying about the critical care of coronavirus patients is that they aren’t suffering from “viral pneumonia,” but rather from an inability to absorb or carry oxygen in the blood.This has been confirmed by NYC ICU emergency physician Cameron Kyle-Sidell, who has released several videos detailing how coronavirus is not a kind of viral pneumonia. “We’re treating the wrong disease,” he says. And the ventilators are damaging the lungs of patients. He explains:COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather, it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30,000 feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen.Watch him explain how coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen starvation, not from a viral pneumonia lung infection:What this emergency room physician makes clear is that coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen deprivation, not a classic scenario of viral pneumonia. The patients’ lungs work fine, in other words, and the ventilators are actually damaging their lungs by forcing excessive pressure into them.How does blood transport oxygen in the first place?How, exactly, can all these patients be starved of oxygen when their lungs are technically working just fine? To understand one possible answer, you have to first understand how the blood carries oxygen. It’s way more fascinating than you might have supposed.When functioning normally, 1 molecule of hemoglobin binds with 4 molecules of oxygen, using iron (Fe2+), forming oxyhemoglobin. But this binding is only achieved because of something called “partial pressure” which means the concentration of oxygen in the lung tissues is higher than the concentration of oxygen on the hemoglobin molecule (roughly stated, this is simplified somewhat), so the oxygen “leaps” to the hemoglobin in order to equalize the partial pressures across the chasm.But 5G radiation alters the porosity of cell membranes, allowing some molecules or ionic elements to move more easily across those members, displacing other molecules (or soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide) that might normally make that leap. For example, it is well documented that 5G radiation causes “Voltage Gated Ion Channels” (VGIC), specifically with calcium ions (VGCC), causing cellular toxicity due to too much calcium entering the cell walls and poisoning the cells.The research on this was published in Environmental Research — here’s the link — and reveals that 5G exposure not only alters cell permeability (porosity), but also releases peroxinitrites in the body. These are inflammation-producing molecules that ravage other healthy molecules circulating in the blood.A thorough review of the available published science on wireless (WiFi) and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) exposure has identified at least seven different ways that WiFi and EMF microwave pollution actively harms the human body.Published in the journal Environmental Research, the peer-reviewed paper explains that exposure to WiFi signals, which are everywhere these days, can lead to: oxidative stress, sperm and testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG (electroencephalogram) changes, apoptosis (programmed cell death), cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload.Note that coronavirus patients are already being observed with neuropsychiatric effects, testicular damage and oxidative stress, three of the symptoms of 5G exposure.We just created this simple chart to point out the similarities between 5G exposure and coronavirus symptoms. Feel free to share everywhere, and link back to this article if possible:Mass insanity due to psychiatric effects of cellular poisoning. We also know that 5G radiation and its effects on the cells of the body can lead to symptoms of insanity, hallucinations and even powerful personality changes. Interestingly, CNN’s Chris Cuomo already described bouts of hallucinations as he was battling the coronavirus, living in a high-5G city (NYC). As I wrote on Natural News last December:5G radiation causes “neuropsychiatric” effects through a mechanism described as ion potentiation poisoning of brain cells, according to research published in Environmental Research.This results in behavioral changes and even personality changes among those who are routinely exposed, researchers found. In other words, 5G is a weapon system that doubles as a telecommunications infrastructure, but the real impact is to damage human brain function and destroy rationality, reason and civility, especially among those who live in high population cities where 5G towers are becoming ubiquitous. That’s why you may have noticed increased insanity and widespread mental derangement in those areas.Part of this effect may also be due to the production of peroxynitrites, which are generated in the body’s cells upon exposure to the voltage emitted by 5G radiation, which is beamed at your body in a narrow cone of high-intensity energy. (5G antennae focus energy in a tight beam that follows you around.) We are already observing the coronavirus causing psychiatric effects, including zombie-like violent, aggressive behavior such as deliberately spitting and coughing on people.How 5G radiation exposure alters the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. Getting back to the oxygen question, the answer to why 5G radiation exposure may alter the function of hemoglobin is found in understanding the protein structure of hemoglobin itself.Hemoglobin relies on something called the “heme group” which is a complex molecule with iron (FE 2+) in its center. This is surrounded by something called a “porphyrin ring” which is a cluster of unique structures (made of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen) that has a special affinity for other oxygen atoms. The ability for oxygen to “leap” onto this molecule in the lungs depends entirely on the structure (which also implies the ionic charges) of these complex molecules.One thing to note in all this is that without the presence of histidine, a special protein, this heme group would have higher affinity toward carbon monoxide than oxygen, meaning the entire heme group would be occupied by carbon monoxide, blocking the absorption of oxygen. Thus, the histidine presence is critical for allowing the heme group to bind with oxygen. If you mess with histidine, you end up forcing hemoglobin to carry CO instead of O2, effectively creating oxygen deprivation in the blood.This heme group, by the way, has special affinity for carbon dioxide, which allows the same molecule to carry CO2 out of the body’s cells and transport CO2 back to the lungs. Remember: The same hemoglobin molecule must carry both CO2 and O2 but at different times, and it must attract and then release those molecules at opposite times in order to rid the body of CO2 and nourish the body with O2. This is all accomplished with a delicate balance of proteins and protein folding.The hemoglobin molecule itself is a miracle of nanotechnology. It transmorphs into two different structural states based on whether it’s carrying oxygen or not. In what’s called the “R-state,” this molecule is like a magnet for oxygen. When four oxygen atoms are bound, it becomes a highly stable structure (and appears red). Technically, the binding of a single molecule of oxygen (O2) increases the affinity toward oxygen on the three other oxygen sites, making the hemoglobin “mop up” four oxygen molecules very quickly. When it lacks oxygen, it changes to a “T-state” and appears blue, which is why low-oxygen blood has a blue color.The important thing to understand in all this is that any alteration of the delicate structure of hemoglobin will impair its ability to bind with oxygen.Take a look at the hemoglobin molecule representation above, from APSUbiology.org, and note the heme groups which are positioned in four places across the molecule. The polypeptide chains are part of the transmorphing structure of the molecule that allows it to carry and release both CO2 and O2, depending on the partial pressures of the gasses at different locations in the body (lungs vs. other cells). Note carefully that any change in the structure of hemoglobin will cause it to stop functioning:Increasing the permeability of the hemoglobin molecule — i.e. its affinity toward other soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide — will “occupy” the hemoglobin molecule with the wrong substances, making it unable to absorb oxygen because it is not presenting in its “R-state” by the time the heart pumps the blood back to the lungs.Stated another way, anything that significantly alters the affinity of hemoglobin toward other soluble gasses (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or even ionic minerals in the blood) could “shut off” the ability of blood to carry oxygen by altering its atomic structure.If you change the structure of the heme group, it no longer functions to transport oxygen. Because in the case of the heme group, the structure is the function. Perhaps this can only be appreciated by organic chemists, but this heme group is truly a miracle of nanotechnology.Here’s a diagram of how iron, histidine, the heme group and O2 oxygen molecules interact with hemoglobin, which alters its structure depending on the “oxygenated” vs. “deoxygenated” forms. Can 5G exposure alter the structure of hemoglobin by increasing its affinity toward other molecules which are not O2?
The real question in all this is best phrased as I have asked it above. I doubt that we are dealing with a phenomenon where 5G radiation exposures blocks the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen, but rather occupies the hemoglobin molecule with other elements that alter its structure and therefore its function, inhibiting its ability to bind with oxygen.This is very likely happening all across the world wherever 5G is currently functioning, it’s just that the coronavirus is now exacerbating the symptoms and conditions to the point where mass death is occurring.In other words, the coronavirus pandemic would likely not be nearly as bad if 5G exposure / radiation pollution wasn’t already compromising the structure and function of hemoglobin cells in the bodies of people who live in 5G cities.This doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t real, of course; just that these two attacks on the human body have a synergistic effect of toxicity and mortality.Conclusion: Humanity is committing suicide with 5G.While I strongly disagree with those who are claiming there’s no such thing as a virus or that the coronavirus is a hoax, I do agree that the widespread deployment of 5G antennas is a kind of suicide pact for the world.Just as the Romans built their aqueducts out of lead linings and thereby poisoned their own citizens, driving them insane with load poisoning, the modern world of Big Tech and telecommunications is mass poisoning humanity with electropollution.Right now, a lot of people are talking about the book, “The Invisible Rainbow” by John Kaminski, who believes coronavirus is an “electrical disease” and that 5G alone is causing all the mass deaths, not the virus. He writes things like, “The flu is not contagious” and “the quarantine is all a terrible hoax.”Surely he is wrong on those claims, but he may not be wrong at all about the toxicity of electropollution and how 5G is actually a kind of “suicide system” that’s destroying humanity.
This all deserves a tremendous amount of additional study, but because we live in a world where Big Tech controls all the narratives and censors all those who question the safety of 5G, it now seems impossible for humanity to extricate itself from this mass suicide mission that has already been unleashed.
And that doesn’t even cover the topic of vaccines. What if Bill Gates’ vaccines are being deliberately engineered to contain toxic substances that 5G exposure will push into the cells, causing widespread death from “binary” exposure and subsequent cell toxicity?It sure would be a simple way for Bill Gates to achieve his global depopulation dreams, all while administering a global IQ test that finds out which people are stupid enough to line up and be injected with a euthanasia weapon system.Watch my video here on how we can end this pandemic and end the lockdowns, too, by turning to nutrition and masks:"
2,"As the “race for the cure” continues in the United States and elsewhere during our current COVID-19 crisis, thousands of people around the world are left with many uncomfortable questions on their mind. For instance: did this version of the coronavirus come from a lab?If the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 virus grew at the hands of researchers sounds farfetched to you, get ready to be surprised.  Published research offers evidence which points to a resounding “YES” to the question “was coronavirus manmade?”We, at NaturalHealth365, would like to extend a special thanks to Peter R. Breggin, MD for providing context and inspiration for this article.Prestigious peer-reviewed journal published study results proving that U.S. and Chinese researchers conspired to create deadly manmade coronavirus
Five years ago, the respected and peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine published a paper from a group of U.S. and Chinese researchers who explicitly tinkered with a bat coronavirus in order to see if it could infect humans.The researchers succeeded!The international team hailed from institutions such as Harvard Medical School, the National Center for Toxicological Research of the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and none other than the Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Both the United States and Chinese governments funded the research.In their paper, titled “A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence,” the researchers acknowledged that they “generated and characterized” a virus (called SHC014-CoV) which at the time was circulating in the Chinese horsehoe bat population. Animal and human cell experiments involving the manmade coronavirus then led to evidence of lung damage and other pathologies. Their experiments also determined that “available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy” for treatment.In other words, these researchers genetically modified and created an animal-based virus that could be infectious to humans and was impervious to exisiting antiviral treatments, including vaccines which “failed to neutralize and protect from infection.”  Eerily similar to the current global pandemic.And yet:We’re supposed believe a paper published in March of this year – published in the very same journal – which states that genomic investigations of the virus  “irrefutably show” that SARS-CoV-2 did not come from a lab and that it is “improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation.”The authors of Nature Medicine‘s March 2020 paper urge people to accept one of two scenarios that more “plausibly explain” the virus’s origin: either natural selection and evolution in an animal host before the virus jumped to humans, or natural selection and evolution in a human host after the virus jumped from animals.We don’t claim to be virologists. All we know is that there are too many unknowns right now. Maybe it’s time for officials to start being way more transparent about this virus’s true origins.Have researchers succeeded in creating the very pandemic monster they were worried about?It’s painfully ironic to think that both the Chinese and United States governments funded (with taxpayer dollars) the laboratory creation of a dangerous and proven deadly pathogen, simply for the apparent purpose to … “prepare” for a future emergence?The level of biosafety and biosecurity risk of such meddling is hard to wrap our head around. It sounds a bit like fighting fire with fire – but makes you wonder who actually is the “winner” in such a fight.Perhaps big pharma and friends pushing for mass vaccinations?“The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV,”  the authors of the 2015 paper write, “underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans.”Yet even their own research, in addition to earlier research from related government-funded studies, seemed to downright spook them. The authors conclude that “scientific review panels may deem similar studies … too risky to pursue”  and that “the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens.”We’re deeply concerned by this revelation and thankful to Dr. Breggin, his scrupulous wife Ginger, and Jef Akst of The Scientist for bringing it to light. It begs the question: what other sorts of experiments are going on in BSL-4 labs like the laboratory in Wuhan?To what extent are government agencies putting the public at dire risk?  So much remains to be seen."
2,"The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. (1) Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.
These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV. This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C's effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, ""Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.""
Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.
Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.
An official statement from Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Hospital (2) reads:On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS)"
2,"President Donald Trump said Friday he will end federal funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology that some are claiming spawned the coronavirus. At the daily coronavirus task force news conference, the president was asked why the National Institutes of Health would include the Chinese laboratory in a $3.7 million dollar stipend to conduct research.“The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million. I’ve been hearing about that. We’ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area, we are looking at it literally about an hour ago and also early in the morning,” Trump said. “We will end the grant very quickly. It was granted quite a while ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money. We are going to look at it and take a look. But I understand it was a number of years ago. When did you hear the grant was made?” The reporter informed the president that the funding was from 2015. Trump noted the date and asked, “2015. Who was president then? I wonder.”Republican Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz raised the issue of the funding earlier this week during an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “I’m against funding Chinese research in our country, but I’m sure against funding it in China. The NIH gives this $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they then advertise that they need coronavirus researchers and following that coronavirus erupts in Wuhan,” Gaetz explained.On Friday, Gaetz tweeted his gratitude to Trump and Health Secretary Alex Azar:  “Thank you President @realDonaldTrump and @SecAzar for committing to end this America Last grant given to labs in Wuhan by the Obama Administration!”Reports claiming that the COVID-19 virus originated in the Wuhan lab and was released to the local community have gained traction in the last week."

2,"The new fifth generation (5G) cellular system that is being installed in major American cities such as Dallas, Atlanta, Waco, Texas, and Sacramento [1, 3] will intensify the microwave radiation health risks for everyone living in those cities.Eleven More Cities Targeted for 5G Deployment this Year.The new 5G cell systems that Verizon and AT&T are planning to install in other cities in 2018 [1, 3] will use shorter length microwaves than the existing 4G (fourth generation) systems. New generation cell phones will be able to communicate with either 5G or 4G microwave towers to optimize connectivity. Copper phone lines will be replaced with 5G rooftop antennas on homes and businesses. These antennas will communicate with 5G cell towers and with the wireless equipment in homes and offices to provide phone and broadband services.5G will be the foundation for the “smart cities” of the future.The Safety of 5G Has Not Been Tested.The microwave frequencies that are being used in this new generation 5G system are in the 1-millimeter wave length.The long-term health risks of these short microwaves have not been adequately tested and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and telecom companies are simply presuming that they are safe based on 1996 research.New Research Reveals Harmful Effects of Cellular Systems. Research on microwave frequency radiation conducted since 1996 shows that the existing 3G and 4G cellular systems are causing serious harm to human health.The 5G systems will increase the level of harm to the level where illness and death can no longer be denied.Harmful Effects are Cumulative.We now know that the development of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and numerous other diseases and disabling symptoms are linked to the cumulative effects of microwave radiation.Cellular systems are pushing microwave radiation into our bodies and brains 24 hours a day regardless of whether we use a cell phone or even own one. A Million or More New 5G Towers will be Erected in American Cities. The 5G towers will be spaced approximately 500 feet apart and will be highly visible eyesores.The “small cell” transmitters will be mounted on top of electric utility poles, municipal buildings, schools, and in city parks, on top of street signs, bus shelters, and anywhere else telecom companies wish.n low lying areas they might need to erect new towers that are taller than electric utility poles to accomplish their objectives. Refrigerator size electrical boxes will be attached to each transmission tower. If you happen to be in an area with underground electric service, then they will erect new towers that use the underground electrical lines.If you live or work in a densely populated area where electrical poles are very close to buildings, then you might have a 5G cell tower located a few feet from your place of employment or your bedroom. It is estimated that the daily microwave exposure generated by the 5G system will be equivalent to living inside a microwave oven and turning it up to high and baking yourself for 19 minutes a day.Telecom Companies Hold the Upper Hand on 5G Tower Placement. FCC regulations [11] make it illegal for government entities to try to delay or stop cell tower installation on the basis of health risks.Telecom companies can sue cities and states that attempt to use health concerns to impede their cell tower building plans.
How Harmful is 5G? Can We Stop It?The remainder of this article provides detailed information about the health risks of 5G and explains why the public and government entities cannot stop the rapid build-out of the 5G system despite the massive health risks.It will link you to efforts in your state where telecom companies are seeking to enact legislation that will strip away all rights to object to cell tower placement on any basis.My previous articles on microwave radiation dangers will provide background information to those who are not familiar with this topic.

2,"How Vitamin C Reduces Severity and Deaths from Serious Viral Respiratory Diseases. Most deaths from coronavirus are caused by pneumonia. Vitamin C has been known, for over 80 years, to greatly benefit pneumonia patients.In 1936 Gander and Niederberger found that vitamin C lowered fever and reduced pain in pneumonia patients.Also in 1936, Hochwald independently reported similar results. He gave 500 mg of vitamin C every ninety minutes.McCormick gave 1000 mg vitamin C intravenously, followed by 500 mg orally every hour. He repeated the injection at least once. On the fourth day, his patient felt so well that he voluntarily resumed work, with no adverse effects.In 1944 Slotkin and Fletcher reported on the prophylactic and therapeutic value of vitamin C in bronchopneumonia, lung abscess, and purulent bronchitis. ""Vitamin C has greatly alleviated this condition and promptly restored normal pulmonary function."" Slotkin further reported that ""Vitamin C has been used routinely by the general surgeons in the Millard Fillmore Hospital, Buffalo, as a prophylactic against pneumonia, with complete disappearance of this complication.""According to the US Centers for Disease Control, there are about 80,000 dead from annual influenzas, escalating to pneumonia, in the USA. Coronavirus is a very serious contagious disease. But contagion to a virus largely depends on the susceptibility of the host. It is well established that low vitamin C levels increase susceptibility to viruses.Vitamin C lowers mortality. It is one thing to be sick from a virus and another thing entirely to die from a viral-instigated disease. It must be emphasized that a mere 200 mg of vitamin C/day resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths among severely ill, hospitalized respiratory disease patients.A single, cheap, big-box discount store vitamin C tablet will provide more than twice the amount used in the study above.And yes, with vitamin C, more is better.Frederick R. Klenner and Robert F. Cathcart successfully treated influenza and pneumonia with very high doses of vitamin C. Klenner published on his results beginning in the 1940s; Cathcart beginning in the 1970s.They used both oral and intravenous administration.""Vitamin C is effective in reducing duration of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.""
A recent placebo controlled study concluded that ""vitamin C should be included in treatment protocol of children with pneumonia so that mortality and morbidity can be reduced."" In this study, the majority of the children were infants under one year of age. By body weight, the modest 200 mg dose given, to tiny babies, would actually be the equivalent of 2,000-3,000 mg/day for an adult.Although many will rightly maintain that the dose should be high, even a low supplemental amount of vitamin C saves lives. This is very important for those with low incomes and few treatment options.We're talking about twenty cents' worth of vitamin C a day to save lives now."
2,"Many people are waking up to the fact that the Covid-19 “pandemic” is not turning out as billed. When we finally emerge from it, the big question will be how many people have died from the virus. Here’s the most likely outcome.You can bet that the institutions of international government, and the “experts” advising them, will try to massage and cherry-pick statistics to present the version of events that most closely matches their worst-case scenarios. The fact is, according to their early predictions, we are already long overdue millions of Covid-19 deaths that have failed to materialise.But even when Covid-19 deaths are recorded, we have seen how it could be that people are dying with coronavirus rather than dying of it. This concept is easy enough to understand, and it encourages one to take a closer look at the breakdown of deaths across an entire society. The more you follow this rabbit hole down, the more interesting the numbers become. It may be somewhat morbid, but it is nonetheless very important.The most popular twoarticles on the website of The Spectator over the weekend were by Dr John Lee, a recently retired NHS consultant and professor of pathology. He remarks that ‘’we have yet to see any statistical evidence for excess deaths, in any part of the world’’.To check this out, I looked at the British government’s own statistics on total deaths registered weekly across the UK. It shows that in the week ending on the 8th of March 2019, 10,898 people died in total in the UK. This year, in the week ending the 6th of March 2020, the equivalent figure was almost identical: 10,895. Make of that what you will. Statistics are currently available up to March 20, and while there is a lag between the spread of the virus and the resulting deaths, so far only about 1 percent of all mortalities bear any relation to coronavirus, and there is no visible spike. If nothing else, it helps to view the extent of the crisis in proportion - thousands of people die each week, and from the long-term view what we are seeing is not a plague, but a blip.So when all is said and done, will any additional people die of the coronavirus? And what is meant by extra or additional?Risk of dying. Understanding this requires a bit of lateral thinking, but it helps to remember that everyone on Earth has a terminal disease: being alive. We all have to go sometime.Recording exactly how and when we do is a big part of the job of statistician Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter. In a recent blog post, he outlined the concept of background risk. This is obtained by recording all of the people dying in any given year, at any given age. At its most simple, this is the percentage chance a person has of not reaching their next birthday, based solely on their age. Of course, that is not to say that if you are a 40-year-old man you have precisely a 0.2% chance of dying this year - the data are based on averages, and do not apply to individuals.But nonetheless, across a country or given populations, the averages will be right, and it is possible to predict with great accuracy how many people will die in a given year. In the UK, for example, 600,000 people die annually. But wait a minute! A novel, brand-spanking new coronavirus is terrorising us all. Therefore surely we can expect more people to die this year than would in a normal year? And come year’s end we should be able, with simple arithmetic, to count exactly how many more there were.Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Evidence and Risk Communication at Cambridge University, won’t say exactly what he does think that figure will be. But he does say that if the deaths are towards the lower end of the current estimates, say at around 20,000 in the UK, Covid-19 will end up having ‘’a minimal impact on overall mortality for 2020’’. He told R4 that his findings showed, to his own professed astonishment, that if someone contracts the coronavirus, they’ve got almost exactly the same chance of dying over the ensuing few weeks as they would normally have of dying over the next year, no matter what their age or background health.And depending on who you ask, that 20,000 figure might still be an overestimate. In fact, Spiegelhalter says that if extra people die it will likely be as a result of the  knock-on effects of the lockdown, such as delayed normal health care, depression and isolation.American political commentator Candace Owens has been Tweeting consistently about the apparent insignificance of Covid-19 deaths compared to overall trends. She tweeted about this issue in relation to New York City, where meaningless figures are being waved around by the media.Final destination
With all of the numbers being bandied about these days by various universities and governments, one would swear that they knew exactly what they were talking about. Make no mistake: this air of certainty is just a front. It is definitely too early to accurately gauge how many – if any – extra people will die because of coronavirus. It will depend on how four key pieces of information intersect.These are:How many people will become infected by Covid-19?How much does Covid-19 increase the risk of death?Are deaths being properly recorded? Of those people who die having contracted coronavirus, are they dying from the virus, or just with it?Of those who died, how many had comorbidities that would have killed them this year anyway?Since all of this began, the mainstream media have focused almost entirely on the first of these points, and stressing with an onslaught of material how important it is to slow the spread. The most extreme possible measures have been implemented to do that. Meanwhile, the three other points could end up comparing Covid-19 pretty much to the common flu. Only careful consideration by governments of all the key factors will result in the best future decisions.It is hard to believe that when this all blows over, the damage that will have been done by the shutdown measures – to businesses, to civil liberties, to individual lives and, of course, to the global economy – could have been for nothing. Nonetheless, it seems entirely possible based on the present data. Remember above all to not  take the figures the mainstream media throw at you at face value; there are lies, damned lies and statistics."

This is part of Agenda ID2020 – and these steps to be implemented now – prepared since long, including by the coronavirus computer simulation at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore on 18 October 2019, sponsored by the WEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
What is the infamous ID2020? It is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. It’s an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity. GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry."

2,"But just last year, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the organization led by Dr. Fauci, funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for working on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses.In 2019, with the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. The program followed another $3.7 million, 5- year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses, which ended in 2019, bringing the total to $7.4 million. Many scientists have criticized the gain of function research, which involves manipulating viruses in the lab to explore their potential for infecting humans because it creates a risk of starting a pandemic from accidental release.The NIH research consisted of two parts. The first part began in 2014 and involved surveillance of bat coronaviruses, and had a budget of $3.7 million. The program funded Shi Zheng-Li, a virologist at the Wuhan lab, and other researchers to investigate and catalog bat coronaviruses in the wild. This part of the project was completed in 2019.A second phase of the project, beginning that year, included additional surveillance work but also gain-of-function research for the purpose of understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. NIH canceled the project just this past Friday, April 24th.A decade ago, during a controversy over gain-of-function research on bird-flu viruses, Dr. Fauci played an important role in promoting the work. He argued that the research was worth the risk it entailed because it enables scientists to make preparations, such as investigating possible anti-viral medications, that could be useful if and when a pandemic occurred. The work in question was a type of gain-of-function research that involved taking wild viruses and passing them through live animals until they mutate into a form that could pose a pandemic threat.The work entailed risks that worried even seasoned researchers. More than 200 scientists called for the work to be halted. The problem, they said, is that it increased the likelihood that a pandemic would occur through a laboratory accident. in 2014, under pressure from the Obama administration, the National of Institutes of Health instituted a moratorium on the work, suspending 21 studies. Three years later, though—in December 2017—the NIH ended the moratorium and the second phase of the NIAID project, which included the gain-of-function research, began. "

2," In the interview, de Monredon said that a recently issued government decree allows French doctors to use the sedative and anti-epileptic drug Rivotril to “euthanize” Covid-19 patients. “Since it’s associated with morphine, it’s a guaranteed death via complete respiratory depression.It was talked about for the elderly in EPHAD [Senior Assisted Living Centers] because they’re not all sent to the hospital; so it’s euthanasia and eugenics,” she said."
2,"At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future.A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place “to protect the people’s health,” Xi said, because lab safety is a “national security” issue.Xi didn’t actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swathes of China had escaped from one of the country’s bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.”
Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”?It turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the epicenter of the epidemic.
That’s right. China’s only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.What’s more, the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.According to the PLA Daily, Gen. Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.
Does that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Gen. Chen’s job is to try and put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me.Add to this China’s history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab where it was — and probably is — being used in experiments. Both “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.
And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them.You heard me right.Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone’s stomach.Also fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die.They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.
I don’t buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don’t carry coronaviruses and that bats aren’t sold at a seafood market. Neither are pangolins, for that matter, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat.The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.China has unleashed a plague on its own people. It’s too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country’s state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high.But not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks “to protect the people’s health.” PLA bioweapons experts are in charge.I doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring. Neither should we."
2,"Having been permanently banned from Twitter for sharing the publicly-available details of the man who ran the show as far a bat-soup virology in Wuhan’s super-secret bio-lab – which is now a common talking point and rapidly shifting from conspiracy theory to conspiracy fact – we thought a reminder of how we got here was in order.(Article by Tyler Durden republished from ZeroHedge.com).Scott Burke,  CEO of crypto-related firm Groundhog, unleashed what we feel may be the most complete timelines of facts to help understand the controversial links between COVID-19 and HIV, and COVID-19 and Wuhan Institute of Virology.Want to go down a (strictly fact-based) rabbit hole?Here is the full slightly-edited-for-formatting twitter thread. A disclaimer: I am not a virologist. This is me synthesizing what we have learned since the outbreak began and reviewing public scientific papers. I believe each of the following statements is a solid fact, backed up by a citation. I also want to say that I understand some people are worried about blame being cast for this outbreak. Obviously we are all in this together, and my intention here is not to cast blame. These links overwhelmingly compel further scrutiny, but are not conclusive.I do think however that information is being downplayed and suppressed by some scientists and media outlets and it’s our duty to find out the facts about this virus, do what we can to mitigate the outbreak, and prevent it from happening again.Ready.So there’s original SARS, which is a type of coronavirus. SARS infects cells through the ACE2 receptor in hosts.The S spike protein plays a key role in how the virus infects cells. Each of the little spikes that surround the coronavirus is a spike protein (or S protein). That’s what gives the coronavirus it’s name – it’s “crown” of these spikes.The S protein binds to the targeted cell through the ACE2 receptor, and boom, your cell is infected and becomes a virus replication factory.After the first SARS outbreak, there was a “land rush” to find other coronaviruses. A collection of SARS-*like* coronaviruses was isolated in several horseshoe bat species over 10 years ago, called SARS-like CoVs, or SL-CoVs. Not SARS exactly, but coronaviruses similar to SARS.In 2007, a team of researchers based in Wuhan, in conjunction with an Australian laboratory, conducted a study with SARS, a SARS-like coronavirus, and HIV-1.The researchers noted that if small changes were made to the S protein, it broke how SARS-CoV worked – it could no longer go in via ACE2. So they inferred the S protein was critical to the SARS attack vector. They also predicted based on the S-ACE2 binding structure, that SARS-like CoVs were not able to use this same attack method (ACE2 mediation).They decided to create a pseudovirus where they essentially put a SARS-like CoV in a HIV envelope. It worked.Using an HIV envelope, they replaced the RBD (receptor binding domain) of SL-CoV with that of SARS-CoV, and used it to successfully infect bats through ACE2 mediation.12 years goes by.A SARS-like CoV begins sweeping the globe that is far more infectious than previous outbreaks.Ground Zero for this outbreak (not first human patient, but first spreading event) is considered to be Wuhan Seafood Market.Wuhan Seafood Market is 20 miles from the National Biosafety Laboratory at Wuhan Institute of Virology.Amidst the outbreak, a team of Indian bioinformatics specialists at Delhi University released a paper pre-print. COVID-19 has a unique sequence about 1,378 nucleotide base pairs long that is not found in related coronaviruses. They claimed to identify genetic similarities in this unique material between COVID-19 and HIV-1. Specifically, they isolated 4 short genetic sequences in key protein structures (the receptor binding domain, or RBD).Two of the sequences were perfect matches (albeit, short), and two of the sequences were matched but each with an additional string of non-matching material appearing in the middle of the sequence.The paper was criticized and numerous attempts have been made to debunk it. After the criticism, the authors voluntarily withdrew it, intending to revise it based on comments made about their technical approach and conclusions.One key debunking attempt claims this:The same sequences are found in a variant called BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, which had been found “in the wild” in bats.This is an attempt to prove that it was not engineered, but mutated naturally in the wild.But there’s a problem.This strain was only known by and studied at the Wuhan Virology Institute, and although they claim it was discovered in 2013, it wasn’t published or shared with the scientific community until immediately after the Indian paper, on January 27, 2020.The RatG13 strain publication and the HIV research paper from 2008 share an author.I discovered this on my own by comparing the two papers and then quickly realized this scientist’s contact information was the information that ZeroHedge was suspended from Twitter for sharing.Their article identifies this author in question including some contact information from the Wuhan Virology Institute web site.You can read the public comments and discussion of the original paper here:There is a line of inquiry about how the sequences are remarkably stable in between the “bat” CoV and the nCoV, where in nature they would likely have mutated in between their shared evolution. Also a call for greater scientific evidence that the strain was collected in the wild.Here is the only point in this thread where I will offer my opinion rather than a list of facts: In light of all the previous facts, the efforts to debunk the paper are not yet convincing in my view. The RaTG13 paper makes the claim that, oh, that HIV-related material you identified that happens to protein fold to become a perfect attack vector for nCoV to attack ACE2?It’s a relative of this other secret virus which came from the wild which we forgot to tell the scientific community about until now for no reason.Here’s the secret virus – it came from bats – and here’s the new virus, see, they have the same HIV-related sequences… so… bats!Totally not secret pathogen research which escaped the lab. What are the odds that a SARS-like coronavirus with overlapping genetics from HIV mutated and crossed over into humans, next door to a laboratory which had been enhancing coronavirus with HIV for over a decade? And conversely, what are the odds it leaked out of the laboratory?Finally, there is a great thread here by Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) examining the evidence for and against, with key replies challenging the conclusions made as well.Let’s learn! What do you think? Maybe I’m wrong! Can anyone disprove any of the links in the chain above? One thing is for sure, the science behind all this is fascinating. But we need to make sure that if viruses are being secretly developed and accidentally released, that we learn about that and do our best to make sure it doesn’t happen again"
2,"In 2019, a mysterious shipment sent from Canada to China was found to contain hidden coronavirus, which Chinese agents working at a Canadian laboratory reportedly stole, obviously without permission.Reports reveal that these Chinese agents were working undercover for the Chinese Biological Warfare Program, and may have infiltrated North America for the sole purpose of hijacking this deadly virus in order to unleash it at a later date.That unleashing could be the coronavirus outbreak that’s currently dominating media headlines – with as many as 44,000 people now infected – despite blame being assigned to contaminated food sold at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China – and here’s why.It was back on June 13, 2012, when a 60-year-old man from Saudi Arabia was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah with a seven-day affliction of fever, cough, expectoration and shortness of breath. The man had no known history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was on no medications, and didn’t smoke, and tests revealed that he had become infected with a previously unknown strain of coronavirus.However, tests could not reveal where the man had contracted coronavirus. So, Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki, the Egyptian virologist who was caring for the man, contacted Ron Fouchier, a premier virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, for advice.Fouchier proceeded to sequence a sample of the virus sent to him by Dr. Zaki using a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to distinguish it from other strains of coronavirus. He then sent it to Dr. Frank Plummer, the Scientific Director of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, on May 4, 2013, where it was replicated for assessment and diagnostic purposes.Scientists in Winnipeg proceeded to test this strain of coronavirus on animals to see which species could catch it. This research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, as well as with the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases, which is in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML).NML, it’s important to note, has long conducted tests with coronavirus, having isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus. This lab had also identified another type of coronavirus, known as NL63, back in 2004.Formerly respected scientist allowed multiple deadly viruses besides coronavirus to be shipped to China. Fast-forward to today, and the recent discovery of the mystery shipment containing coronavirus can be traced all the way back to these samples that were sent to Canada for analysis, suggesting that the current coronavirus outbreak was likely stolen as a bioweapon to be released for just such a time as this.According to reports, the shipment occurred back in March of 2019, which caused a major scandal with biowarfare experts who questioned why Canada was purportedly sending lethal viruses to China. It was later discovered in July that Chinese virologists had stolen. it, and were forcibly dispatched as a result.
“The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.,” explains a report by Great Game India, as republished by Zero Hedge.“The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu,” it goes on to explain, adding that Qiu had served as head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section of the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.A formerly respected scientist in China, Qiu began studying powerful viruses in 2006. In 2014, many of these viruses she studied, including not only coronavirus but also Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, and Hendra, all suddenly appeared in China as part of a massive hijacking.Be sure to read the full report at ZeroHedge.com.You can also keep up with the latest coronavirus news by visiting Outbreak.news."

2,"There is only one existing treatment for the new coronavirus: vitamin C.Vitamin C supports your immune system.Vitamin C helps to kill the virus and reduces the symptoms of infection.It's not a COVID ""cure,"" but nothing is.It might just save your life, though, and will definitely reduce the severity of the infection.If someone tells you it's not proven, consider two things:Nothing is proven to work against COVID-19, because it is a new virus.Vitamin C has worked against every single virus including influenzas, pneumonia, and even poliomyelitis.What to do.If you do nothing else, start taking vitamin C right away; at least 3 grams a day, spread right across the day. That's a 1,000 milligram capsule every 8 hours, or a level teaspoon of powder dissolved in a pint or so of water, drank all through the day.If you're smart and motivated, do all the other things recommended in our previous release Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus.When and if you catch a bug that might be COVID-19, simply increase your vitamin C intake: a rounded teaspoon (that's 4 to 5 grams) in water (which helps to keep you hydrated) every 3 or 4 hours. And keep on taking it.Do you consult a doctor? Do you self-isolate? Yes and yes. Of course you do; that's your duty to others.Vitamin C and the other measures are what you do for yourself.These links provide a large number of references to back up our above statements:"

2,"In lockstep with Mr. Microsoft (Bill Gates) himself, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) head Dr. Anthony Fauci has signaled that Americans will eventually be able to return back to normal after the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis ends. But this will probably only be the case if they agree to get vaccinated and carry around digital proof of vaccination everywhere they go.Speaking on CNN‘s “New Day” program, Fauci stated that requiring digital vaccine certificates is a “possible” outcome of the pandemic because “it’s one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not.”“This is something that’s being discussed,” he added. “I think it might actually have some merit.”Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican, has similarly proposed that the government create some type of immune registry to keep track of people who are no longer believed to be at risk of infection with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). One possible way to do this is to administer antibody testing, which could potentially indicate whether or not someone has already had the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and is now recovered and immune to it.Very soon, Fauci says, there will be a “rather large number” of tests available for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). But a potential problem will be validating them as accurate, seeing as how early Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) tests were wildly inaccurate.“It’s very likely that there are a large number of people out there that have been infected, have been asymptomatic, and did not know they were infected,” Fauci admitted. “If their antibody test is positive, one can formulate kind of strategies about whether or not they would be at risk or vulnerable to get infected.”Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how food riots could begin as soon as May if the lockdowns across our country don’t come to an end very soon:Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci want to force the mark of the beast on you in the name of stopping coronavirus. Fauci’s buddy Gates has a similar plan in mind that involves giving people a digital mark of the beast that “approves” them for reentry back into society once they’ve been deemed “safe” following mandatory vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).Gates has stated that he would like to see everyone have a “quantum dot tattoo” microchip inserted into their bodies that would not only “clear” them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), but also function as a digital form of identification (ID2020) that includes the entirety of a person’s medical records.
Even though simple zinc is already proving to be a viable “cure” for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) – no vaccines required – the world’s most outspoken eugenicist at the current time is insistent upon vaccinating the entire globe against this virus in order to keep everyone “safe” from any diseases it might cause.
“The corporate elite that runs things behind the scenes has turned an illness no more. dangerous than the common flu into a pretext for an enormous expansion of government power and an enormous transfer of money from the citizens to the corporate elite,” wrote one Washington Times commenter in response to this news.“Most people still believe – despite so much evidence to the contrary – that the government and the corporate media do not lie, especially about the big things. In reality, the government and the corporate media lie about everything – especially about the big things.”"

2,"On May 15-16th, as part of the True Legends “Ancient Cataclysms and Coming Catastrophes” online conference organized by Steve Quayle at GenSix.com, I will be presenting a nearly three-hour talk entitled, “The Depopulation Trifecta: Coronavirus, vaccines and 5G.”The two-day streaming event also features Bob Griswold, Derek Gilbert, Celeste Solum, L.A. Marzulli and many other gifted presenters and thought leaders.
The series focuses on dire catastrophes that humanity may be facing right now or in the near future.My own talk focuses on what I call the “trifecta” of assaults against humanity: The coronavirus, vaccines and 5G. These are indicative of biological weapons, chemical weapons and electromagnetic weapons, all formed and deployed against humanity in order to achieve the global depopulation that people like Bill Gates so desperately seek to achieve.Here’s an overview of the sections of my talk:The beliefs of the globalists: What they are trying to achieve through depopulation. (Hint: Planet Earth is being prepared for a post-human era.).How we are already in a biological war launched by globalists to destroy human freedom and exterminate most of the human population. The coronavirus attack wave is just the first of many to come.The three weapons of extermination: Bioweapons, vaccines and 5G – How they synergistically function to both enslave and exterminate the human race through electromagnetic weapons, chemical weapons and biological weapons, all without resorting to nuclear weapons that would pollute the planet for all life forms.The three layers of collapse: Debt (finance), Health and Cognition – how the collapse is being engineered at these three levels to attack the body, the mind and the spirit.How the information war against humanity is being waged with censorship of natural cures, independent journalism and pro-human information, where online information gatekeepers are actively pursuing an anti-human, anti-life agenda that ends with the mass extermination of most humans living today.Also in the presentation:How to survive the culling of the human race:Nutritional strategies to protect yourself from 5G exposure (and save your brain).Strategic relocation to evade the high population density targets such as US cities. How to make yourself resilient against the planned, engineered food supply collapse.How to preserve your wealth and assets to survive a global debt reset. How to protect your health from the multiple waves of bioweapons that will be released.Which hard assets to acquire that will be the most resilient against global geopolitical collapse.How globalists will seize control over the internet and block all traffic to sites they don’t want you to read.The “Fourth Turning” revolution that’s coming to the world as middle class workers grow tired of being looted by the elite.Streaming access is available at GenSix.com. A DVD set will is also available for pre-order. I am not compensated in any way for sales of streaming or DVDs, or anything else. I’m participating in this event out of respect for Steve Quayle’s mission to try to awaken humanity before it’s too late for us all.
Spread the word. This is going to be a must-see event to understand what we all face in the months ahead. Humanity has been targeted for termination, and most people have no clue what’s coming."
2,"Europ is in panic. It’s targeted not only by a new wave of illegal migrants sent by Turkey and the collapse of energy markets, but also by a coronavirus threat. Over the past days, Italy became the key center of the coronavirus outbreak sparking declarations about a total lockdown.The virus, known as Covid-19, has now infected close to 115,000 people worldwide and resulted in more than 4,000 deaths. The majority of these cases are in mainland China, where the outbreak first emerged. As of March 10, a total of 80,761 cases and 3,136 deaths were registered. However, Beijing seems to be gaing an upper hand and the rate of infection has been slowing significantly in the country, and the situation stabilizing. Over 60,000 people recovered and during the past 24 hours, there were only 26 new coronavirus cases registered in mainland China. The nubmer of coronavirus cases per 1 million of population stands at approximately 56.1.South Korea, which was another epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, is also dealing with the situation successfully. The toal number of cases is 7,513. The number of death is 54. During the past 24 hours there were 35 new cases registered only. The total number of cases per 1 million of people is 146.5.The situation is fully different in Europe. During the past few days only, Italy (mostly), France and Spain turned to be the center of chaos and virus hysteria. The speed and scale of the outbreak is surprising. According to live updates, there were a total of 9,172 cases registered in Italy with 463 deaths already. 1,797 new cases and 97 new deaths were registered on March 9 only. The number of total cases per 1 million of population is 151.7. This is higher than in China and South Korea despite the fact that the density of population in Italy is much lower.The crisis in France and Span is not so acute, but it also surprising.Europe has almost 1.5 months to prepare for the spreading coronavirus problem. However, no effective measures were apparently employed. The disregard to epidemiological norms and measures needed to combat the oubreak is among the key issues named by local sources.Until recently, all limitations and measures employed by Italian authorities were merely a formality. On March 9, the northern region of Lombardy and 14 other provinces were placed under lockdown. Additional measures included blanket travel restrictions, a ban on all public events, the closures of schools and public spaces such as movie theaters, and the suspension of religious services including funerals or weddings. However, Italy is already the center of the outbreak and all these measures appear to be at least late.For example, India, which is located relatively near such centers of the outbreak as South Korea, China and Iran, did not fall into such a crisis. The difference is in the measures employed.There is little doubt that the coronavirus threat is overestimated by mainstream media and governemnts. Covid-19 is in fact an ordinary viral disease with a slightly higher mortality from complications for people of old age or peopel with weakened immunity. Another open secret is that the current hysteria over the outbreak is being successfully used by some players to achieve their own economic and geopolitical goals. Looking at the current situation in Europe, one could suppose that some forces have seized an opportunity and are now fueling the coronavirus crisis intentionally."

2,"From conspiracy theory to geopolitical realism, the possibility to treat COVID-19 as a biological weapon has been finally accepted in the public sphere. The recent statement by the Chinese spokesman Zhao Lijian, formally accusing the US of bringing coronavirus to China, has highlighted a series of new opinions about the pandemic.The hypothesis of biological warfare behind the global pandemic had already been raised by Russian experts some weeks ago. Like any opinion that is slightly different from the official version of Western governments and their media agencies, the thesis was ridiculed and accused of being a “conspiracy theory”. However, as soon as the official spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the second largest economic power on the planet publishes a note attesting to this possibility, it leaves the sphere of “conspiracy theories” to enter the scene of public opinion and official government versions.In addition to making the explanation of biological warfare official, Zhao Lijian raised important questions about the pandemic data in the USA: “When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!”The supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, ordered on the same day of the declaration of the Chinese Ministry the creation of a unified center of scientific research specialized in the fight against the coronavirus. The motivation, according to the Iranian spiritual and political leader, was motivated by evidence that the pandemic is a biological attack. These are his words:“The establishment of a headquarters to fight the outbreak [of COVID-19] occurs due to the presence of evidence that indicates the possibility of a biological attack, signaling that it is necessary that all coping services [to the coronavirus] be under the command of a unified headquarters”.In fact, what the mainstream Western media has called a “conspiracy” has been manifested in US defense programs for a long time. We must briefly recall the official document named “Rebuilding America’s Defenses”, published by the conservative think tank “Project for a new American Century”, where we can clearly read: “(…) advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool “.Taking into account that the document was published in 2000, we can see that the possibility of biological warfare has been carefully considered and worked on by American strategists for at least two decades. However, the projects are even older. This article published in Global Research tells a brief history of biological warfare technology, tracing the remote origins of this practice by the American armed forces. In this genealogy of biological warfare, we find reports of the use of bio-weapons in wars in great conflicts of the last century, such as the Second World War, the Korea War and the conflicts with Cuba. Even so, until last Thursday, the mere fact of mentioning this hypothesis for the new coronavirus was rejected as conspiracy.We must attain to concrete data: Pentagon has 400 military laboratories around the world, whose activities are still obscure; the USA has not yet made a clear statement about the COVID-19 data in its territory, having not yet informed the identity of its patient zero and maintaining uncertain information about the number of infected; Chinese scientists conducted a complex study in which they concluded that the virus did not originate in China, but that it had multiple and diverse sources from the Huanan marine seafood market from where the virus subsequently spread.In February, the Japanese media agency Ashi TV reported that the virus originated in the U.S., not China, and that Washington would be omitting its actual numbers, with some cases of death attributed to influenza being, in fact, camouflaged cases of coronavirus; on February 27, a Taiwanese virologist presented a series of flowcharts on a TV program, corroborating the thesis that the virus has an American origin, providing a scientific explanation to the flow of the virus sources devoid of any geopolitical purpose.Another curious fact is that China has been unexpectedly affected by epidemic phenomena, particularly during the period of the trade war between Beijing and Washington. Only between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the country recorded epidemic episodes of H7N4, H7N9 (two variations of bird flu) and African swine flu. Also, the US has not officially responded to any of these notes, remaining silent about the coronavirus situation in its territory.Not proposing a concrete answer, but only speculations, we can consider that the circumstances of the case present us a very extensive list of possibilities about what in fact the coronavirus is. Obviously, it is possible that it is not a biological weapon – and this is the official version of most of the media agencies and governments – however, once this hypothesis has been raised and no concrete evidence to the contrary is presented, it is also possible that it is a biological weapon.The most important thing to do is to dispel the myth that biological wars are conspiracy theories. We must begin to take this possibility seriously and analyze the evidences in search of real solutions. Biological weapons are methods that have long been used and that form a fundamental part of modern warfare, whose costs are less than the methods of direct confrontation of the old wars of mobilization – and whose benefits are greater."
2,"CORONAVIRUS chaos appeared to come out of the blue as the illness has swiftly impacted countries all over the world. However, it has emerged that scientists warned about a new deadly virus long ago, deeming it a remote threat at the time and dubbing it ""Disease X"".The World Health Organisation released a report in 2017 in which various pathogens that posed a risk and needed addressing were listed. Featuring among the threats were Nipah disease, which causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). The list was comprised of viruses which had no known treatments or vaccines, and all had the potential to trigger pandemics that could kill thousands – just as Ebola and swine flu did in previous years.But later on, a new illness was added: Disease X.The mysterious name referred to “a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown”.It added that humanity should now be working to seek out and tackle unknown diseases, but assumed they would remain a remote threat for some time.The recent outbreak of coronavirus – known as Covid-19 – bears similarities to the description of Disease X and suggests that researchers underestimated the danger of an enigmatic virus they the likes they warned of three years earlier.As the NHS highlights, coronavirus' main symptoms include a cough, a high temperature and shortness of breath.While scientists have been able to flag various illnesses as potential threats, some have argued that the research has been negligent in some areas, allowing the coronavirus breakout to occur under the radar.Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust said: “World health authorities have spent a lot of time and money making plans for dealing with the next major outbreak, which was assumed would be an influenza pandemic. A lot of investment has gone into making influenza vaccines, for example.“But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don’t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.""We just didn’t envisage a Disease X emerging on the scale we had seen with an influenza pandemic. We will do that in future.”The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China reached 1,770 as of the end of Sunday, up by 105 from the previous day.At least 100 of the new deaths were from the province of Hubei, the epicentre of the epidemic, the Commission said on Monday morning.Across the country, there were 2,048 new confirmed infections, about 1,933 from Hubei alone, pushing the new total to 70,548.But there are fears that Africa, a continent yet to be heavily impacted by the chaos, could be extremely vulnerable should the illness arrive on its shores.Given that healthcare resources in many of the countries are scarce, and infrastructure pales in comparison to more developed countries, the death toll could rise significantly if the continent becomes affected.The epicentre of the pandemic is in Wuhan, China, and given that the country has grown its political and economic links to a number of African countries, people in places such as Nigeria and South Africa are especially at risk.Other nations among the 13 labelled as more vulnerable than most include Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, leading the World Health Organisation to mark these areas as high priority.Trade moving between China and Africa accumulated more than £150billion in 2018, figures from the China-Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies shows.The closer political and economic ties between Beijing and the continent mean that Africa could be vulnerable in the future."

3,"For months, the mainstream media has been pretending as though it desperately wants to save lives by combating the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) through any means necessary. But once President Donald Trump actually presented a promising solution, they all flipped a switch nearly in unison. According to Attorney General William Barr, news coverage about the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine quickly shifted the moment Trump endorsed its usage, even though Dr. Anthony Fauci himself endorsed the drug back in 2013 during the Obama years when it was used to treat SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), two ""cousins"" of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). ""Before the president said anything about it, there was fair and balanced coverage of this very promising drug and the fact that it had such a long track record that the risks were pretty well-known, and as soon as he said something positive about it, the media has been on a jihad to discredit the drug,"" Barr is quoted as saying. ""It’s quite strange,"" he added. ""The stridency of the partisan attacks on him has gotten higher and higher, and it’s gotten disappointing to see."" What could be the key to quickly getting everyone out of lockdown and back to normal is being vilified by Fauci, the media, and other anti-Trump elements that, in many ways, seem to want the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to continue spreading. After all, if they really wanted to stop this scourge, then they’d be supportive of any possible solution, regardless of who presents it. Describing hydroxychloroquine as a ""game changer"" in the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), President Trump’s recent announcement appeared to shock many deep state hacks who were clearly planning to unveil mandatory vaccinations as the ""solution,"" not some generic pharmaceutical that won’t make any of them rich. This is presumably why he’s now under attack both by the mouthpieces of Operation Mockingbird and by leftovers in his administration such as Fauci. Barr, at least, is thrilled that Trump made the announcement, also declaring his entire handling of the situation to be ""statesmanlike."" On the other hand, Barr stated that the White House press corps has been asking a lot of ""snarky gotcha questions"" to try to derail his efforts. Some in the media are claiming that Trump cited a ""flawed"" study out of France, which suggested that hydroxychloroquine may be effective against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). But this hasn’t phased Trump, who also recently announced that his administration had purchased ""a tremendous amount"" of the drug, which is to be distributed to the states following emergency approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The day before this, White House economic adviser Peter Navarro reportedly got into a heated argument with Fauci over the drug, which Fauci has been downplaying despite his previous endorsements while working under Obama. Fauci continues to claim that there exists no ""strong"" evidence to suggest that hydroxychloroquine works for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and that it shouldn’t be prescribed because of this. ""Day by day there are more articles about the success of the drug in combination with some other drug,"" wrote one Zero Hedge commenter about the news. ""Yes, it may have side effects but it has been in use since 1955 … I am not aware of one article that has spoken about how this drug has failed."""
3,"In case you have not noticed, the ""old normal"" is never coming back now that the globalists have tipped the dominoes to usher in the ""new normal."" What comes next is a man-made extinction-level event (ELE) that will eventually depopulate the world to minimal levels. Complicit in this conspiracy are bioterrorists from the government, large corporations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), secret societies and terrorist organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), all of which are working in cahoots to kill as many people as possible with deadly ""vaccines"" and other fake medical interventions. Going beyond the Chinese origins of the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) itself, of more pressing concern are the injections being widely dispensed that are reprogramming human DNA and turning people into walking spike protein factories. This is an irreversible phenomenon with deadly implications in the longer term. ""Now that the dangerous and deadly COVID-19 vaccines have gained widespread use, the swiftly evolving worldwide regime defined by the Covid Super Vaccination Agenda will contribute markedly to the ELE,"" warns The Millennium Report. ""Because of the RNA and DNA altering aspects of the Covid injections, these ‘vaccinations’ cannot be undone. Consequently, those vaccinated individuals will either succumb to the ELE or become severely incapacitated to the point of becoming a great burden to their caretakers."" To learn more about the ELE being brought about by the widespread administration of Wuhan Flu shots, visit ChemicalViolence.com. Chinese Virus injections are designed to kill you when the time is right The five key elements to the ELE are the Chinese Virus bioweapon and its associated ""variants,"" chemical-biological aerosols being sprayed in the skies, the military deployment of 5G energy weapons, the annual ""flu vaccine"" program, and the injection of stealth Chinese Virus bioweapons. All of these elements are working together to kill off the vast majority of the world’s population, leaving behind a much smaller slave class that will cater to every whim of the ""elite"" class. This is all in motion and taking place right before our very eyes. According to The Millennium Report, the most important element, and the last to be deployed, is the almighty Chinese Virus injection. This quaternary weapon system is being tested in various forms all around the world from various drug manufacturers with different results. It would appear as though the globalists are testing the lethality of one jab over another to figure out which one needs to be elevated to the top of the heap as the most effective at killing off the most people. ""Coronavirus COVID-19, 5G 60 GHz millimeter wave, chemtrail-disseminated ‘smart dust’ and vaccine-delivered digitized RNA are mutually intensifying quaternary weapons deliberately launched and coordinated to shut down a targeted city or nation, commit genocide, depopulate and / or trigger an ELE,"" the report further explains. DARPA-Big Pharma bioengineers keep themselves busy reformulating ""vaccines"" to make them progressively more deadly. This is what the upcoming ""boosters"" are for, which have absolutely nothing to do with protecting people against Chinese Virus ""variants."" The whole thing is a depopulation scam that, sadly, millions of Americans are buying into hook, line and sinker without a second thought. On the flip side, there does appear to be a majority, at least currently, that is just saying no to the jab, no matter the pressure imposed on them. Will it be enough to stop this heinous scheme? Unfortunately, said scheme is already in motion and will only progress with time. The endgame is total enslavement of the planet under a medical-fascist police state, which we are already seeing take shape right in front of us."
3,"Scientists initially thought that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), does not mutate as readily as the viruses that cause flu, hepatitis or AIDS. The molecular ""proofreading"" system that SARS-CoV-2 – the virus behind COVID-19 – and its kin use to prevent damaging genetic errors when replicating supposedly made them stable. But these scientists were eventually proven wrong. Several new variants of the original virus have been spotted in different countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil. The mutation appeared to cause major changes to its contagiousness and the way the virus acts in general. ""What we’re seeing is similar mutations arising in multiple places,"" said Adam Lauring, a virologist at the University of Michigan. ""That’s pretty suggestive that these mutations are doing something."" These mutations seemed to make the virus transmit more readily and evade the immune system. (Related: Mutation has caused the coronavirus to become more contagious but less deadly, says new study.) Five most prominent coronavirus mutations In January, researchers reported for the first time that antibodies from individuals with COVID-19 did not completely neutralize a variant first identified in South Africa. A few people who recovered from the disease also appeared to have been reinfected with the mutant virus. According to Scientific American, the five of the most prominent variants discovered are 20A.EU1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P1 and P2. The 20A.EU1 variant, first identified in Spain, contains a mutation called A222V on the viral spike protein. The spike is a component of the coronavirus that binds to a receptor on human cells called ACE2, and this attachment helps the virus get inside those cells and infect them. The spike protein is also the part of the pathogen that is targeted by human antibodies when they fight back against the infection. In lab tests, human antibodies were slightly less effective at neutralizing viruses with the A222V mutation. Over the course of several months, the 20A.EU1 variant became the dominant one in Europe. But epidemiologists never saw any evidence that it was more transmissible than the original. Researchers believe that when Europe began lifting travel restrictions last summer, the variant that was dominant in Spain spread across the continent. Scientists in the UK had been watching the B.1.1.7 variant for some time before announcing in December last year that it might be at least 50 percent more transmissible than the original form. That announcement was based on epidemiological data that showed the virus rapidly spreading throughout the nation. And it led to international travel bans and stronger lockdown measures in the UK. Despite initial concerns, there has been no real evidence that the variant is more infectious in children than the original, said University of Cambridge microbiologist Sharon Peacock, who is also the executive director of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium, a group that analyzes genetic changes to the virus. Both Pfizer and Moderna believe that their COVID-19 vaccines will still work against B.1.1.7. Recent data from the UK hint that the variant may be more lethal than the original, but the analyses are preliminary. The B.1.351 variant appeared around the same time as B.1.1.7, and it spread quickly in South Africa to become the dominant version in that country. Like its European counterpart, B.1.351 contains the N501Y mutation, although evidence seems to suggest the two variants arose independently. But scientists are more concerned about another mutation called E484K that appears in the South African version. The genetic change may help the virus evade the immune system and vaccines. In January, researchers reported they had detected two new variants in Brazil, both descendants of a somewhat older common ancestor variant. Of the two, researchers were more concerned about P.1. That variant contains more mutations than P.2 (though both have the E484K mutation), and it has already been seen in Japan and other countries. Big Pharma may need to make updated version of coronavirus vaccines Early last year, scientists at the U.K.’s University of Bath and the University of Edinburgh said that SARS-CoV-2 is being mutated by human proteins that degrade it, and that ""natural selection"" of the virus is enabling it to bounce back. ""Natural selection – survival of the fittest – is allowing the virus to fight back against the mutational process,"" the scientists said. Professor Laurence Hurst, director of the Milner Center for Evolution at the University of Bath, said: ""I have looked at mutational profiles for many organisms and they all show some sort of bias, but I’ve never seen one as strong and strange as this."" The scientists noted that all organisms mutate but this is usually a random process as a result of mistakes made when DNA is copied. ""In the case of SARS-CoV-2, mutation may well not be a random process and that instead humans are mutating it, as part of a defense mechanism to degrade the virus,"" the scientists explained. According to the scientists, the results of possible mutations could have implications for vaccine design. ""Knowing what selection favors and disfavors in the virus is really helpful in understanding what an attenuated version should look like,"" said Hurst. Vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer seem to work against the new variants, although Moderna has started developing a booster shot specific to new variants. Experts said a slight drop in effectiveness would still make both vaccines worth using because they showed more than 90 percent effectiveness in trials. ""I’m optimistic this won’t compromise the [COVID vaccines], but obviously, it’s something we’ve got to watch closely,"" Lauring said, adding that companies may need to retool these vaccines and administer updated versions in the coming years, much in the same way that flu vaccines are revised each year."
3,"Walker says that Directed Evolution is different than Gain-of-Function, which is defined as ""a mutation that confers new or enhanced activity on a protein."" In other words, it means that a virus such as COVID can become more potent depending on the mutation / scientific experiment performed on it.  The Pfizer executive told a Veritas journalist about his company’s plan for COVID vaccines, while acknowledging that people would not like this information if it went public.  ""One of the things we [Pfizer] are exploring is like, why don’t we just mutate it [COVID] ourselves so we could create — preemptively develop new vaccines, right? So, we have to do that. If we’re gonna do that though, there’s a risk of like, as you could imagine — no one wants to be having a pharma company mutating f**king viruses,"" Walker said.  ""From what I’ve heard is they [Pfizer scientists] are optimizing it [COVID mutation process], but they’re going slow because everyone is very cautious — obviously they don’t want to accelerate it too much. I think they are also just trying to do it as an exploratory thing because you obviously don’t want to advertise that you are figuring out future mutations,"" he said.  ""Don’t tell anyone. Promise you won’t tell anyone. The way it [the experiment] would work is that we put the virus in monkeys, and we successively cause them to keep infecting each other, and we collect serial samples from them.""  Walker drew parallels between this current Pfizer project and what may have happened at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.  ""You have to be very controlled to make sure that this virus [COVID] that you mutate doesn’t create something that just goes everywhere. Which, I suspect, is the way that the virus started in Wuhan, to be honest. It makes no sense that this virus popped out of nowhere. It’s bullsh*t,"" he said.  ""You’re not supposed to do Gain-of-Function research with viruses. Regularly not. We can do these selected structure mutations to make them more potent. There is research ongoing about that. I don’t know how that is going to work. There better not be any more outbreaks because Jesus Christ,"" he said.  Walker also told the Veritas journalist that COVID has been instrumental for Pfizer’s recent business success:  Walker:Part of what they [Pfizer scientists] want to do is, to some extent, to try to figure out, you know, how there are all these new strains and variants that just pop up. So, it’s like trying to catch them before they pop up and we can develop a vaccine prophylactically, like, for new variants. So, that’s why they like, do it controlled in a lab, where they say this is a new epitope, and so if it comes out later on in the public, we already have a vaccine working.  Veritas Journalist:Oh my God. That’s perfect. Isn’t that the best business model though? Just control nature before nature even happens itself? Right?  Walker:Yeah. If it works.  Veritas Journalist:What do you mean if it works?  Walker:Because some of the times there are mutations that pop up that we are not prepared for. Like with Delta and Omicron. And things like that. Who knows? Either way, it’s going to be a cash cow. COVID is going to be a cash cow for us for a while going forward. Like obviously.  Veritas Journalist:Well, I think the whole research of the viruses and mutating it, like, would be the ultimate cash cow.  Walker:Yeah, it’d be perfect.  Walker went on to explain how Big Pharma and government officials, such as at the Food & Drug Administration [FDA], have mutual interests, and how that is not in the best interest of the American people:  Walker:[Big Pharma] is a revolving door for all government officials.  Veritas Journalist:Wow.  Walker:In any industry though. So, in the pharma industry, all the people who review our drugs — eventually most of them will come work for pharma companies. And in the military, defense government officials eventually work for defense companies afterwards.  …  Veritas Journalist:How do you feel about that revolving door?  Walker:It’s pretty good for the industry to be honest. It’s bad for everybody else in America.  Veritas Journalist:Why is it bad for everybody else?  Walker:Because when the regulators reviewing our drugs know that once they stop regulating, they are going to work for the company, they are not going to be as hard towards the company that’s going to give them a job."
3,"Discussing a New England Journal of Medicine article authored by FDA vaccine advisory panelist Dr. Paul Offit, NBC covers his view the jabs should be reserved for older or immunocompromised people as their development is failing to keep up with evolving Covid variants. From NBC‘s report, ""Younger, healthy people don’t need another Covid booster, vaccine expert says,""  A key adviser to the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine panel is questioning whether more Covid booster shots are necessary for healthy, younger people.  The evidence for the new versions of the vaccines for the omicron variant of the coronavirus, which the FDA authorized in August, is ""underwhelming"" and fails to show they are much better than the original shots, Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician who is a leading vaccine and infectious diseases expert, wrote Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Protecting people against Covid infection with the current mRNA technology may be a pipe dream, especially as new coronavirus strains emerge every few months, Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told NBC News.  The updated boosters from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are probably best reserved for people at high risk of severe illness or death from Covid — older adults, people with multiple coexisting conditions and those who are immunocompromised, Offit said.  Asking young, healthy people who have a lower risk of serious illness to get boosted with a variant-specific vaccine, followed by a different variant-specific formula a few months later, may not be practical, he said.  In his NEJM paper, Offit claimed the jabs offer some protection against severe infection, however went on to say boosting against specific strains that ""might disappear in a few months"" is essentially useless for young, healthy people.  Although boosting with a bivalent vaccine is likely to have a similar effect as boosting with a monovalent vaccine, booster dosing is probably best reserved for the people most likely to need protection against severe disease — specifically, older adults, people with multiple coexisting conditions that put them at high risk for serious illness, and those who are immunocompromised. In the meantime, I believe we should stop trying to prevent all symptomatic infections in healthy, young people by boosting them with vaccines containing mRNA from strains that might disappear a few months later.  To his credit, Offit, a staunch vaccine and social distancing advocate who frequently appears on CNN, has been against the FDA’s booster scheme since early on and has been appearing on mainstream media to promote his theory boosters don’t benefit young, healthy people.  On the other hand, Infowars has shown evidence from various sources that the jabs actually appear to be weakening, suppressing and destroying the immune system, making the boosters highly questionable even for elderly and immunocompromised individuals.  Entrepreneur Steve Kirsch argues Offit’s booster jab skepticism was evidence enough no one should be taking them, saying, ""One of the world’s most respected vaccinologists admits that there are no benefits to the boosters. He’s not taking the boosters. Why should you?"""
3,"The health board for Nevada’s Elko County voted to defer banning the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and flu vaccines in the county. Members of the board unanimously agreed that they lacked authority to impose such ban.  But they’re also not forcing people to get vaccinated.  ""It’s important for us to remember that people need to be in charge of their own health care from the beginning,"" said Commissioner Delmo Andreozzi, a member of the health board. Elko County Health Officer Dr. Bryce Putnam, also a member of the health board, noted that receiving a vaccine is a personal choice even though he himself is a profound advocate for vaccination.  Commissioner Rex Steninger agreed with his colleagues. ""We can’t order people to wear masks. I feel the same way about this moratorium,"" he said. ""If somebody wants to take the vaccine, that’s their decision.""  County commissioners earlier took hard stances against what they considered ""government overreach."" They voted to disregard a mask mandate reimposed in August 2021 by former Gov. Steve Sisolak to curb the spread of the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. They also banned the use of vaccine passports by any county agency in July 2021, and unanimously rejected a $500,000 grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in November 2022.  During the board’s Jan. 18 meeting, they also voted against a ""discussion and consideration of a request to discontinue local advertising for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines pending further investigation and results of the Florida Supreme Court case to investigate the wrongdoing related to COVID-19 vaccines.""  Back in December, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis requested the Sunshine State’s high court convene a grand jury to investigate any possible side effects of COVID-19 vaccines and to get more information from pharmaceutical companies. (Related: DeSantis pushes to remove vaccine mandates, allow vaccine-injured to sue for damages.)  Elko County Commissioner Jon Karr, a member of the health board, said the vaccine-related items should not even be on the agenda as they do not put the county in a positive light.  ""Our legal already said, ‘You can go ahead and do that,'"" he told 2News. ""You don’t have any right to tell the hospital, ‘Don’t do a vaccine’ or, all of a sudden, you can’t tell the radio stations they can’t advertise. We don’t have that authority anyway.""  According to Karr, a concerned resident spoke about possible problems with vaccines – including heart problems and cardiac inflammation. The said resident cited DeSantis’ efforts to investigate COVID-19 vaccines.  ACLU’s threat may have played a role in the vote Threat of legal action from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada also played a role in the vote. The civil rights nonprofit penned a letter for the health board, warning that it would file a lawsuit if members proceed with a moratorium on the COVID-19 and flu vaccines, as well as their marketing.  ""A moratorium on vaccinations would be an egregious injustice,"" ACLU representatives said in the letter. ""Whether those in Elko [County] take advantage of influenza or COVID vaccines, offered readily throughout the country, is not your decision.""  Because of this, the health board rejected the proposed bans despite support from a majority of community members who testified during public comment."
3,"German authorities want to put a famous Jewish composer and Holocaust survivor into a psychiatric clinic and force her to take the COVID injection.  (Article by Andreas Wailzer republished from LifeSiteNews.com)  Inna Zhvanetskaya, who lives in Stuttgart, Germany, was supposed to be taken to a psychiatric institution and forcefully injected with the COVID jabs on January 11, according to the news outlet Report24, which has been in personal contact with Zhvanetskaya.  However, according to several reports, she has been transferred to a safe place by friendly activists who wanted to prevent her arrest.  The 85-year-old Zhvanetskaya sent a video message to Report24 saying that ""music is my life, and if they take away music from me then they take my life.""  Report24 also received a copy of the court order, which authorizes her forceful transfer to a psychiatric institution and for her to be forcefully injected with the COVID-19 shots ""for her own good.""  The court order was officially appointed by her professional guardian, which seems somewhat contradictory given that the German national federation of professional guardians is strictly against forced vaccinations of patients against their wishes, according to statements made on their website.  The court order claims that Zhvanetskaya has been diagnosed with several mental illnesses, including dementia, delusional disorder, narcissistic ""grandeur self-image,"" egocentrism and logorrhea. She also allegedly suffers from severe obesity and heart disease.  However, many of these diagnoses were called into question by critics after the story made the rounds in alternative media circles. Report24 journalist Will Huber pointed out that Zhvanetskaya does not appear to be extremely overweight in the video she sent, which seems to contradict the claim that she is severely obese.  Mascha Orel, co-founder of a humanitarian organization for holocaust survivors, reportedly spoke with Zhvanetskaya and said she cannot confirm any of the diagnoses that were alleged in the court order.  ""I talked to her on the phone for an hour,"" Orel said, according to a report by TKP. ""She is vulnerable, frightened, and has lived in this state for about two years, as her legal guardian has apparently tried to institutionalize her several times.""  ""She drew an unequivocal comparison: ‘It’s like when Dad was at the front and Mom had to flee with me and my brother.’""  Orel said that Zhvanetskaya is introverted and autistic but added that this is ""normal for a highly talented artist.""  Orel also mentioned that Zhvanetskaya did not want to take her medication at one point and that this was likely a reason for her legal guardian to call for her to be institutionalized.  Zhvanetskaya’s father, who was a doctor, ""probably also taught her to weigh the benefits and risks. She has a very conscious approach to the subject and that is probably why she refused the vaccination so staunchly,"" Orel said.  Another interesting detail about the court order is the fact that it claims Zhvanetskaya’s birthday is on January 20, 1939, even though all other sources say that she was born in 1937.  Many lawyers, activists, doctors, and alternative media outlets have come to the defense of Zhvanetskaya and have blasted the action taken by German authorities.  ""This decision is a gigantic judicial scandal,"" lawyer and expert for medical law Beate Bahner wrote in a Telegram post.  Professor Martin Haditsch, who was one of Austria’s most famous critics of the COVID-related government measures, said that the forced vaccination represents a violation of the Nuremberg Code, which forbids medical experiments on humans since the COVID injections were not properly tested before being introduced to the market.  Zhvanetskaya’s lawyer, Holger Fischer, who appealed the court order, gave an update on his Telegram channel on January 12, saying the district court of Stuttgart granted his urgent application to suspend the compulsory vaccination until the decision on the appeal is made. However, Zhvanetskaya could still be forcefully institutionalized at any point, according to Fischer.  The Jewish composer was born in 1937 in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. The city was occupied by Nazi Germany between July 1941 and March 1944. She created numerous works of classical music throughout her career that were played by orchestras around the world."
3,"A noted lawmaker said China was clear about its biological weapons ambitions long before the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak that turned into a global pandemic.  Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, along with other Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), have released a report about the origins of the viral outbreak.  ""Our State Department has put things out over the past, even going back to 2005, that China is interested in offensive bioweapons,"" Wenstrup told the ""Capitol Report"" program on NTD, the sister media outlet of the Epoch Times, on Dec. 16 – two days after the report was published.  The Ohio Republican pointed to research done by the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Fifth Institute of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), which is the top medical research organization for the Chinese military.  ""In 2005, the U.S. State Department publicly stated the U.S. assessment that China also operates an offensive biological weapons program, specifically identifying two Chinese entities as likely involved, one of which is the Fifth Institute. In a 2006 declaration of compliance with the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention, China acknowledged that the Fifth Institute specifically conducts research on SARS coronaviruses,"" the report noted.  ""Indeed, a review of academic research on the PubMed database maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health shows Fifth Institute scientists have extensively published research on coronaviruses, including work conducted with researchers at the WIV (Wuhan Institute of Virology). In short, the AMMS’ Fifth Institute has a long history with China’s bioweapons program, coronaviruses, and the WIV.""  In his interview, Wenstrup also noted a book titled ""The Unnatural Origin of SARS and New Species of Artificial Humanized Viruses as Genetic Weapons,"" which was released by AMMS in 2015.  ""The book described how to create weaponized chimeric SARS coronaviruses, the potentially broader scope for their use compared to traditional bioweapons, and the benefits of being able to plausibly deny that such chimeric coronaviruses were artificially created rather than naturally occurring,"" the report noted.  Wenstrup, who is also a medical doctor, said that the ChiCom military research center collaborated with the WIV, the facility at the center of the theory that COVID-19 was developed and then accidentally leaked or was purposely released.  ""The central premise of the AMMS book is that SARS-CoV-1, the strain of coronavirus that caused the 2002 SARS outbreak, did not emerge naturally but was a chimeric virus artificially engineered as a genetic weapon to infect humans,"" the congressional report stated.  ""The book described the PLA researchers’ broader belief that other nations are developing chimeric coronaviruses to use as genetic weapons. The authors described how to create weaponized chimeric SARS coronaviruses, the potentially broader scope for their use compared to traditional bioweapons, and the benefits of being able to plausibly deny that such chimeric coronaviruses were artificially created rather than naturally occurring.""  Wenstrup mentioned a scientist with the Chinese military’s Fifth Institute, General Zhou Yusen, who may have worked with the WIV for years before the pandemic. Wenstrup said that Zhou was ""heavy into the gain of function type research or chimeric research,"" which is believed to have created COVID-19.  ""Notably, in the spring of 2020, as global COVID-19 cases surpassed seven million and COVID-19 deaths surpassed 400,000, General Zhou reportedly died under mysterious circumstances,"" according to the GOP report.  There’s little doubt that China was responsible for creating and spreading COVID-19. This latest report merely confirmed that belief while adding many new details."
3,"Twitter CEO Elon Musk blasted President Joe Biden’s outgoing Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci on Wednesday, December 28, for overseeing the creation of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) bioweapon that has killed millions around the world.  ""Important to note that Fauci authored a 2012 paper arguing for gain-of-function research,"" Musk tweeted. He then cited an article published by Yahoo on March 2021, where Fauci backed the gain-of-function experiments based on his paper written back in 2012.  According to Fauci, the research is ""important work"" and the benefits of such experiments as well as the resulting knowledge outweigh the risks.  ""Some good nuggets in the article. ‘Gain-of-function‘ in this context is just another way of saying ‘bioweapon,'"" the tech mogul pointed out.  In the paper, the retiring National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director said such research involves making viruses more infectious and/or deadly.  A lot of experts have been coming out with analyses that found the possibility of COVID-19 to have originated from a potential lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in Wuhan, China, where gain-of-function experiments on bat coronaviruses had been conducted.  Musk noted that former President Barack Obama ""wisely put this on pause, but Fauci restarted it."" In 2014, the Obama administration paused funding for gain-of-function experiments in 22 fields, including those involving SARS, influenza and MERS because of the increased risk such experimentation carries of causing a pandemic.  When Fauci wrote the paper supporting gain-of-function research, there was a voluntary ban on such experiments related to highly infectious influenza viruses. Yet the EcoHealth Alliance diverted $600,000 in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the head agency of NIAID, to the WIV in the form of sub-grants from 2014 through 2019 to study bat coronaviruses.  Fauci maintained that no U.S. funding went to WIV for gain-of-function research, but conceded during congressional testimony last year that it was impossible to guarantee that researchers at the WIV did not use American funds to perform gain-of-function research on coronaviruses. (Related: Fauci ""knew"" he was funding illegal gain-of-function research, says former CDC director.)  Musk hints Fauci needs to be prosecuted Musk also took a swipe on Fauci earlier in December, saying: ""My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci."" While the post did not include context, it still drew support from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.  Also, Twitter user @hodgetwins replied to Musk’s tweet: ""Let me guess. You found messages between Twitter execs and our government (Fauci and team) pushing for censorship of anyone that didn’t go along with their narrative on COVID?"" Musk responded with a trophy emoticon. He also replied with a simple ""Yes"" when another user inquired if this will be explained in the next set of Twitter Files.  While Musk’s tweet acquired roughly half a million likes in its first few hours online, the post also received backlash. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist and virology professor, defended Fauci’s work at the forefront of U.S. pandemic mitigation efforts and urged Musk to remove the post.  ""For the record: Dr. Fauci has done nothing wrong, except serve our nation. In the meantime, Mr. Musk should know that 200,000 Americans needlessly lost their lives from COVID due to this kind of antiscience rhetoric and disinformation. Elon, I’m asking you to take down this Tweet,"" Hotez wrote. Musk has not responded publicly.  About an hour before posting the tweet about Fauci, Musk shared a meme with a caption that read in part, ""Just one more lockdown,"" which could be interpreted as an allusion to Fauci’s advocacy for safety mandates that public health experts, including those in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, agreed were helpful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 before vaccines became widely available."
3,"People who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19 face a substantially higher risk of getting in a car crash than vaccinated people, which could justify higher insurance rates for the unvaccinated, according to a study published this month in The American Journal of Medicine.  (Article republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org)  The study didn’t find that being unvaccinated causes traffic accidents. Instead, the researchers postulated that there is a psychological reason why ""vaccine hesitant"" people ""might also neglect basic road safety guidelines.""  John Campbell, Ph.D., a nurse educator, and comedian and political commentator Russell Brand were among the critics who took issue with the study, citing its flaws and questioning the motives behind doing such a study.  Others were more blunt. Norman Fenton, Ph.D., a professor of risk information management at Queen Mary London University, accused the journal of publishing ""a study in stupidity.""  Dr. Vinay Prasad, a hematologist-oncologist at the University of California San Francisco tweeted:   Researchers investigated correlation — not causation  The study’s authors analyzed encrypted government data from 178 Ontario medical centers and more than 11.2 million residents of the province, of whom 84% had received a COVID-19 vaccine and 16% had not as of July 31, 2021.  Among the study cohort, 6,682 people needed emergency care because they were involved in a serious car accident — either as a driver, a passenger or a pedestrian — during the one-month period the researchers analyzed.  Unvaccinated people accounted for 25% of the traffic accidents (1,682 cases), meaning they had a 72% increased risk of accidents relative to those who had taken the jab.  When researchers adjusted for other variables such as age, sex, socioeconomic status and other medical conditions, the relative increased risk for the unvaccinated dropped to 48%.  The researchers said their findings are significant because, ""A relative risk of this magnitude … exceeds the safety gains from modern automobile engineering advances and also imposes risks on other road users.""  Although the authors noted the study did not investigate or demonstrate any causal link between being unvaccinated and risky driving, they proposed several possible causes for the correlation they found.  They thought there could be ""a distrust of government or belief in freedom that contributes to both vaccination preferences and increased traffic risks.""  Other explanations, the researchers said, might be ""misconceptions of everyday risks, faith in natural protection, antipathy toward regulation, chronic poverty, exposure to misinformation, insufficient resources, or other personal beliefs.""  The authors concluded that ""COVID vaccine hesitancy is associated with significant increased risks of a traffic crash. An awareness of these risks might help to encourage more COVID vaccination.""  ‘This is ludicrous’  The researchers did not address numerous limitations in the data they presented, according to Campbell, who provided a full analysis of the study.  ""The obvious response to that is to say, well this is ludicrous, which it is, but … [the] evidence needs to be unpacked,"" said Campbell, an expert on vaccine administration.  During the study period, the unvaccinated were more likely to drive — and therefore at higher risk for accidents — yet the study did not account for differences in miles driven.  In Canada, for much of 2021, unvaccinated people could not use public transportation, which would have compelled them to drive more. Essential workers in non-healthcare settings who had to commute to work lived in neighborhoods with higher rates of COVID-19 and lower vaccination rates. Vaccinated people were more likely to work remotely or to be retired.  Contrary to the study’s implication that people in accidents were practicing ""risky driving,"" most cases were actually passengers or pedestrians. Of the 6,682 crashes, only 2,856 of those cases were drivers — 1,189 were passengers and 2,637 were pedestrians, whose accidents did not result from their driving practices.  Campbell reported that the study classified people as unvaccinated for 14 days after vaccination.  Given that the study lasted only a month, vaccinated people could have been characterized as unvaccinated for up to half of the study. If 602 people were misclassified in this way, the difference between the two groups disappears.  All deaths at the scene were excluded. If a cardiac or other event — possibly vaccine-related — caused the accident, it was not included in the study, Campbell said.  Major statistical flaws make study ‘a joke’  In a Twitter thread, Dr. Claire Craig, with the U.K.’s Queen’s College, University of Oxford, called the study ""a joke,"" pointing to major statistical flaws.  The researchers undercounted unvaccinated people because they compared two sets of data — the number of people who went to the hospital after an accident and the number of people in the government vaccination database. They did not account for unvaccinated people who are not in the government vaccination databases, Craig said.  Undercounting unvaccinated people skewed the numbers so it appeared that unvaccinated people were at consistently higher risk for every condition they measured for, according to Craig.  She concluded:   Health data and the rise of biodigital surveillance  According to the study footnotes, the researchers accessed a large government dataset held at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, which they used to analyze risk by correlating vaccination status with socioeconomic information, detailed healthcare records and other data.  They concluded that ""The observed risks might also justify changes to driver insurance policies in the future.""  According to a recent investigation by ProPublica, health insurance companies are increasingly collecting vast amounts of information to determine insurance costs on an individual basis.  ProPublica reported:  ""With little public scrutiny, the health insurance industry has joined forces with data brokers to vacuum up personal details about hundreds of millions of Americans, including, odds are, many readers of this story.  ""The companies are tracking your race, education level, TV habits, marital status, net worth. They’re collecting what you post on social media, whether you’re behind on your bills, what you order online.  ""Then they feed this information into complicated computer algorithms that spit out predictions about how much your health care could cost them.""  Companies outside the narrow scope of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which prohibits healthcare providers from disclosing protected patient information — from data brokers to period-tracking apps — can and do legally sell people’s health-related information, from information about their surgical procedures to their mental health conditions.  These practices can help the industry boost profits by avoiding coverage for sick people.  But they are also part of a broader trend toward digital surveillance and control through the mass collection of people’s personal data and the creation of digital IDs.  Plans for digital IDs have been in the works for several years, but they gained traction during the pandemic.  The ID2020 Alliance, founded in 2016 with seed money from Microsoft Accenture, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Rockefeller Foundation, Cisco, and Gavi (a vaccine alliance founded by the Gates Foundation) claims to advocate in favor of ""ethical, privacy-protecting approaches to digital ID,"" with the mission of providing digital IDs for people worldwide by 2030.  The digital IDs would be tied to biometric data, demographic information, medical records, education data, financial data and more.  This year, Bill Gates announced $200 million more funding for digital ID projects globally.  Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these organizations advocated for using health and immunization records as a way to scale up digital IDs, an idea they also promoted at the World Economic Forum in Davos.  Governments have already begun to use people’s health data to manipulate their behavior. In January, Quebec announced that it planned to place a significant ""health tax"" on unvaccinated people. During the pandemic, ""vaccine passports"" were widely required for access to public spaces.  Last month, leaders of the Group of 20 (G-20) issued a joint declaration promoting a global standard on proof of vaccination for international travel and calling for the establishment of ""global digital health networks"" that build on existing digital COVID-19 vaccine passport schemes.  Vaccine passports, digital identities, social credit systems, and central bank digital currencies together can form a system of digital control, computer scientist Aman Jabbi explained in a recent interview with ZeeMedia. Such a system depends on data collected through surveillance cameras, smart devices, and the increasing use of biometric data for everyday transactions.  According to Brand:  ""This is why it is all the more concerning that we are seeing again, through the process of commerce and convenience, new technology introduced that will give centralized Big Tech resources — which as you know are deeply interpolated with political and government agencies — the ability to garner more of your data.""  Warning about the conclusions of the study, he continued:  ""So in a sense, you could see how a story saying that people who didn’t get vaccinated are causing car crashes while there are new investigations into the efficacy of those vaccines that were, as I recall, quite aggressively pushed means that we oughtn’t be marching open-hearted with our trousers down into the arms of data capture organizations even if they are saying that they are ultimately going to offer us other services.  ""There’s enough evidence to suggest that these Big Tech platforms and data-capture giants operate in coordination with the government to push an agenda that is not beneficial to anybody but themselves."""
3,"A pair of cardiologists are warning people to stop getting mRNA coronavirus vaccines because the more doses a person takes, the more likely they could suffer heart damage.  The Epoch Times reported that Dr. Aseem Malhotra and Dr. Peter McCullough say the vaccines have done more harm than good and that a large percentage of people who have taken the jabs have suffered enduring health problems, in particular with their hearts. As such, the administration of the vaccines has to be halted, and the sooner, the better.  They even cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) V-Safe data, which found that one-quarter of those who took an mRNA vaccine were incapacitated the next day, with around 8 percent seeking attention in an emergency room or having to be hospitalized.  ""This is the most toxic vaccine by the CDC data that we’ve ever seen in clinical medicine,"" McCullough said during a recent interview with Malhotra for EpochTV’s ""American Thought Leaders"" program.  McCullough is one of the most published cardiologists in the country, as well as being the chief scientific officer of The Wellness Company. He believes the 8 percent who went to the hospital most likely had contracted COVID-19 before they got their vaccine.  ""I think all cardiovascular conditions have got worse because of the vaccine, and anything and everything that can go wrong with the heart has gone wrong with the heart as a result of this mRNA vaccine,"" added Malhotra, who has written a great deal about how to reverse heart disease by changing lifestyles.  ""The part of the virus that causes the heart damage is called the spike protein,"" said McCullough.  The Epoch Times added:  Myocarditis is one of the more common injuries caused when the patient gets a high dose of spike protein with the shot, the doctors said, so the claim by the mainstream medical establishment that the risk of myocarditis is greater without the vaccine is false.  In addition, there is no evidence to support the claim by the drug industry that mild infection with COVID-19 or the omicron variant is causing sudden death, said Malhotra.  ""There is a risk for traditional cardiovascular events because of this big inflammatory incident the body gets with COVID respiratory illness, but there is a small negligible risk of myocarditis with COVID, the respiratory infection, probably because the body doesn’t get this massive exposure to the spike protein, as it does with the vaccines,"" said McCullough.  ""I think people shouldn’t be distracted by this false narrative that mild COVID may be causing a massive surge in cardiac arrests,"" Malhotra said, adding that he believes there would have been far less harm to the public if the mRNA vaccines had not been used.  ""These vaccines have had a hugely negative impact on society, on health, and of course, everything that’s gone on with it has eroded trust, as well, in medicine,"" he said. ""What was most criminal is telling people who had natural immunity to take the vaccine.""  McCullough also indicated that the way the vaccine trials were conducted was also problematic and incorrect. He noted that when the big pharma companies and the Food and Drug Administration were registering people for the trials, they rejected anyone who had contracted the virus and women who were pregnant or who could become pregnant.  ""When we have exclusion criteria in clinical trials, the exclusions must be justified, and the rationale to justify the exclusion was, they did not have an opportunity for benefit and they had an opportunity for harm,"" he said.  The doctors also said that the pandemic is over, so there is no reason to continue any emergency measures because of it.  ""We’re dealing with a cold"" now, said Malhotra. ""People need to be told the truth. We need to stop scaring people."""
3,"Outgoing White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has admitted that his daughter previously worked as a software engineer at Twitter and that he spoke with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg multiple times during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  In a full sworn statement of Fauci on the ongoing case regarding social media censorship, it was revealed that Fauci’s daughter worked for Twitter at the start of the pandemic. He, however, said in the deposition released by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt on Monday, Dec. 5, that they never discussed content posted to social media as a response to a question thrown by Attorney D. John Sauer. (Related: Twitter slaps down Project Veritas moments after exposing major Fauci ""gain of function"" research lie with ban from platform.)  ""Did you ever discuss with her the origins of the virus or concerns about the origins of the virus?"" Sauer asked.  ""No, she has no interest in that,"" Fauci answered and added that she stopped working for the platform ""over a year ago.""  The retiring National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director insisted that he is not interested in any social media platforms and does not have personal accounts on Twitter or Facebook.  ""I don’t do any of that, so I’m not familiar with that. I’ve never gotten involved in any of that,"" he claimed. However, when asked by Sauer if he knew anyone that worked for social media companies at the time, he replied: ""Well, I’ve had communications with Mark Zuckerberg in the past who was – I’ve done, I believe, three outward FaceTime discussions encouraging people to get vaccinated.""  He replied ""I don’t recall"" 174 times throughout the deposition, which is part of a social media censorship lawsuit filed by Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry earlier this year.  The lawsuit alleged that key figures in the Biden administration, including President Joe Biden himself, ""have colluded with and/or coerced social media companies to suppress disfavored speakers, viewpoints and content on social media platforms by labeling the content ‘dis-information,’ ‘misinformation’ and ‘mal-information.'""  When activist and radio talk show host Charlie Kirk tweeted the news about Fauci’s daughter previously working at Twitter, the platform’s new CEO Elon Musk responded with two words: ""Small world.""  Musk suspends Twitter’s COVID-19 misinformation policy As of November 23, Twitter no longer enforces the COVID-19 misinformation policy according to its online rules. The next day, users of the social media platform started testing the new boundaries and celebrating the platform’s hands-off approach.  ""This policy was used to silence people across the world who questioned the media narrative surrounding the virus and treatment options,"" physician Dr. Simone Gold said. ""A win for free speech and medical freedom.""  As expected, the so-called ""experts"" in public health and other fields didn’t like this development, saying that the changes in Twitter policies can have serious consequences.  ""Bad news,"" epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding tweeted. He urged people not to flee Twitter, but to keep up the fight against bad information about the virus. ""Stay folks – do NOT cede the town square to them!""  Paul Russo, a social media researcher and dean of the Katz School of Science and Health at Yeshiva University in New York, also criticized Musk’s move.  ""It is 100 percent the responsibility of the platform to protect its users from harmful content,"" Russo said. ""This is absolutely unacceptable."""
3,"As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread throughout the United States, it is exploding in New York City. Research shows thousands of infected persons from New York spread coronavirus through much of the country before the city began implementing its lockdown protocols. The unrestricted travel helped fuel outbreaks in Louisiana, Texas, Arizona and even in West Coast states.  The data has been drawn from geneticists tracking signature mutations of the virus, the travel histories of people with COVID-19 and outbreak models made by infectious disease experts.  ""We now have enough data to feel pretty confident that New York was the primary gateway for the rest of the country,"" said epidemiologist Nathan Grubaugh of the Yale School of Public Health.  NYC joins other urban hot spots around the world, such as Wuhan in China, Milan in Italy and Qom in Iran, which all have become vectors for coronavirus.   New York City becomes ""Grand Central Station"" of coronavirus On March 14, NYC closed down all of the city’s public libraries; this was followed by the city’s schools on March 15; and on March 17, theaters, nightclubs and concert venues were also shut down. The following week, on March 22, Gov. Andrew Cuomo put the whole state on lockdown.  Despite the lockdown, the coronavirus still continued to spread throughout the U.S. because by this time, NYC had already turned into the ""Grand Central Station"" of coronavirus, according to David Engelthaler, head of infectious disease at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Arizona.  What this means is that the city acted late to prevent the domestic spread of the coronavirus. However, even if they had locked down the city – and the state – early enough, the virus probably would have continued to spread. One of America’s early outbreaks came from Seattle. This spread the coronavirus throughout Washington state and across 14 other states, including Connecticut and Maryland in the Eastern Seaboard.  But the spread of the Seattle outbreak was nothing compared to the spread of NYC. By the end of February, thousands of infected people had passed through the city and, during crucial weeks in March when the city would have been able to take decisive action to quell the spread of the virus, the city’s political leaders waited too long before taking aggressive action. This, despite the fact that NYC already had tens of thousands of cases by the time Cuomo shut down the whole state.   Genetic signatures of coronavirus can be traced back to New York City Geneticists analyzed and shared over 2,000 coronavirus samples from infected people all over the country.  As the virus spread throughout the U.S., it replicates and picks up different mutations which, while they don’t change the behavior of the virus, can help researchers pinpoint the virus’ origins.  Many of the samples taken from COVID-19 patients in Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Louisiana, Idaho and many other states carried with them distinct mutations that the geneticists traced back to New York. Grubaugh estimated that infections that spread from NYC accounted for around 60 to 65 percent of the virus samples they sequenced. However, other scientists want to take more samples before calculating precise figures.  Despite that, Grubaugh and the other researchers agreed that travelers from New York has played a prominent role in the spread of the coronavirus across the United States. They believe the national spread may have begun in early March, around two weeks before the state’s lockdown orders were issued. This is supported by The New York Times, who analyzed cellphone and travel data and found that the severity of the outbreak in certain areas depended on how many people in that location had been to New York in the past two weeks.  The analysis also found that a majority of the viruses tied to New York had a distinct genetic signature that they were able to link to outbreaks in Europe, suggesting that European visitors to the city helped spread the virus. This contrasts with the Seattle outbreak, which had genetic signatures linking directly traceable to China. (Related: New York City becomes the new Wuhan: Big Apple now the new US epicenter of global coronavirus pandemic.)  NYC and Seattle aren’t the only sources of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Other large urban areas have also contributed to the spread, and the coronavirus is showing a more diverse genetic mix, especially in areas in the Midwest and in parts of the South.  Furthermore, even as domestic travel was spreading coronavirus throughout the country, international travelers were also bringing the virus in, which is why some scientists believe it may be too early to put a lot of the blame on NYC alone. It is still possible, they argue, that some of the virus samples the geneticists attributed to NYC may have instead come from Europe, especially through direct flights or lay-overs in NYC.  For this reason, some scientists want to continue their research and gather more samples to try and figure out how the coronavirus spread so rapidly throughout the U.S. – and possibly figure out a way to better halt it dead in its tracks."
3,"Lockdown orders throughout the country to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) are nearing their end, but it’s too early to rejoice. Experts even suggest that it would be wise to order second lockdowns to ensure that they are not lifted prematurely.  While the future is uncertain, here are some tips for preppers who want to get ready before the next coronavirus lockdowns are enforced.  Are extended lockdowns necessary? Note that the coronavirus won’t just disappear after you observe lockdown orders. Even after the lockdown period is over, there’s still the chance that you can get infected if you spend time outdoors without taking precautions.  According to experts, it is likely that the country will suffer a ""second wave"" of coronavirus infections. Some suggest it might occur soon after lockdown ends, but others say that there could be a seasonal link and that it will happen sometime in the Fall.  There are rumors from China about a possible second wave of coronavirus, but reliable reports from the country have been hard to come by since the pandemic began.  Researchers have yet to determine if recovering from coronavirus grants former patients immunity to the disease. Conflicting data notes that it’s impossible to develop immunity, while other reports say antibodies in the plasma of recovered patients can benefit those who are currently infected.  Signs hint at an incoming second wave of infections. As a prepper, it is your responsibility to prepare for the worst and to learn from your experiences during the first lockdowns put in place to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.  Things you need to do differently Regardless of when the second surge of coronavirus infections happen, you need to be prepared for the second round of lockdowns.  Learn from your previous mistakes and how you handled scenarios such as:  Running out of food during the lockdown. Not having essential non-food supplies in your stockpile. Not having access to items you’ll need to repair appliances in your homestead. Not having toys or books to entertain kids or other family members. Review the preps you were satisfied with, and do them again to get ready for a second lockdown. (Related: A prepper’s guide to surviving a coronavirus lockdown.)  Having enough cash in your emergency funds. Being able to cook delicious and nutritious meals using your food supplies. Not needing to leave the house for emergency supply runs. Review your two lists, then make a third list of the things you need to buy or need to do before the second lockdown.  Replenish your supply of ingredients for favorite meals. Buy more items that you ran out of first. Restock your pantry so you have what you need for another long-term lockdown. Purchase tools and repair materials for your gear. Buy things that will keep your family entertained. Finalize an inventory of supplies so you can replenish your stockpile. Review your budget You may be one of the millions of Americans who experienced dramatic changes in their incomes over the last few months.  If you’re barely able to cover your bills, you may have trouble stocking up for another lockdown. If this is one of your concerns, review your budget. Take advantage of whatever the government via financial assistance.  Don’t waste money on things you don’t need, and see if you can cut any fixed expenses.  Items to buy for the next lockdown Here are some supplies that you might need more of. Once you have reviewed your budget, set aside some money, and start stocking up before things get any worse.  Baking powder Baking soda Bleach Canned fruits – Opt for canned fruits with no added sugar. The vitamin C levels will vary from 45 percent (peaches) to 90 percent (grapefruit) of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) per serving, depending on the type of canned fruit you buy. Canned fish – Fish is rich in both protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Canned fish like anchovies, salmon, sardines and tuna can be used in sandwiches for lunch and main dishes. If the nearest store is offering promotions or discounts, buy dozens of cans that have a long shelf life. Canned vegetables – Vegetables like carrots, corn, green beans and peas are full of fiber and vitamin C. Disinfectant cleaners Dried fruit – Dried fruit is another source of essential nutrients. Use dried fruit as toppings for cereal, oatmeal and yogurt. Alternatively, you can bake with dried fruit for a much-needed sweet treat during the lockdown. Dry foods (e.g., pasta and rice) Flour Hand sanitizer Lysol wipes Meat Paper plates Paper towels Toilet paper Vitamin C supplements If your area doesn’t enforce a second lockdown, you can still use these items in your stockpile for the next long-term SHTF scenario.  Start replenishing your supplies immediately. Don’t buy these things all at once so you don’t use up too much of your funds. If your tools and appliances need some repairs, get them taken care of before the next lockdown takes effect.  Prepare your family before SHTF again Make sure your family members are better prepared for another lockdown. Note how your family behaved during the first lockdown, and see if any of them had trouble dealing with the changes, such as not being allowed to come and go as they please.  If a loved one was depressed, anxious, or feeling lonely during the initial lockdown, talk to them in private and let them know that their feelings are valid, particularly during times of dramatic change.  Teach them that being prepared for a second lockdown is one way of helping themselves move past these feelings and accomplish the things that must be done for the survival of your whole family.  Monitor the news and get your family used to the possibility of another lockdown. You don’t need to scare them, but make it known that they should be ready for whatever happens in the next few weeks."
3,"As many parts of the country are starting to reopen their economies, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has argued that officials need to be upfront about the human cost of these reopenings. The governor said that the debate on when to reopen outbreak-hit economies ultimately boils down to the value placed on people’s lives.  ""How much is a human life worth?"" Cuomo asked during his daily news briefing. ""That’s the real discussion that no one is admitting openly or freely. But we should.""  Factoring in the human cost of reopening The governor of the state hit hardest by the coronavirus (COVID-19) made the argument in the face of mounting political pressure to relax epidemic-fighting restrictions. For New York, Cuomo adopted a slower approach that will allow parts of the state to phase in economic activity later this month if they’re able to meet and maintain a series of benchmarks.  ""The faster we reopen, the lower the economic cost — but the higher the human cost, because the more lives lost,"" the governor said. ""That, my friends, is the decision we are really making.""  According to Cuomo, his plan avoids the trade-off between economic and human costs, because it will be controlled by officials constantly monitoring fatalities and hospitalizations. (Related: Talking about reopening the economy, Texas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick says ""There are more important things than living."")  Cuomo also reported that the state had 230 deaths Tuesday. This number is slightly up from the previous day, but far lower than the daily peak of 799 on April 8. The state has had more than 19,000 deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic began. The state total, however, does not include more than 5,300 New York City deaths that were blamed on the virus but were not verified in lab tests.  New York’s hospitalization rates also continued to drop, with only 659 new admissions reported Monday — the lowest number since March. Overall, the state has seen 9,600 patients hospitalized from the virus.  New York will reopen in phases On Monday, Gov. Cuomo presented a soft blueprint for how New York’s economy might begin to restart, laying down a set of criteria that will determine which regions allow what sectors to open.  ""This is not a sustainable situation,"" Cuomo said of the shutdown, now in its seventh week. ""Close down everything, close down the economy, lock yourself in the home. You can do it for a short period of time, but you can’t do it forever.""  According to Cuomo, the state will rely heavily on progress in key areas — declines in positive virus cases and deaths, and increases in testing, contact tracing and hospital capacity — under a complex formula that will determine when parts of the state would be eligible to reopen.  Once the requirements are met, the first phase of the plan would allow for manufacturing, construction and some retail stores to reopen for curbside pickup, after May 15. This is similar to what California is doing.  After two weeks, the effects of the first phase would be evaluated. If the indicators are still positive, the second phase would allow professional services, as well as more retailers and real estate firms to reopen, perhaps as soon as the end of May.  The third phase would allow restaurants, bars and hotels to reopen. This would be followed by a fourth and final phase that would include cinemas and theaters, including Broadway.  ""It’s just common sense,"" said Broadway League president Charlotte St. Martin of the plan which will see her industry open last. ""We hate it, but we get it.""  In addition to theaters, schools, which have been canceled statewide for the rest of the academic year, will also be covered in the final phase of reopenings."
3,"A Colorado medic who had volunteered to help fight the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City passed away on April 30. Paul Cary had come all the way from Denver to help out in the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. before succumbing to the disease himself.  ""It was so busy when we first got here… We had a few long days,"" stated fellow paramedic and friend, Royce Davis. Both Davis and Cary were stationed in the Bronx where they were helping with facility transfers with on-demand ambulance service Ambulnz. Davis recalls how they would constantly look out for each other amid the city’s battle with the coronavirus.  ""We would see each other every day, check up on each other, make sure we were rested, and doing good,"" Davis recalled.  Cary volunteered to help even though he was retired Cary, a retired firefighter who worked for three decades with Aurora Fire Rescue, arrived in New York City in late March, days before authorities issued an emergency alert ""seeking licensed health care workers.""  For three weeks, Cary drove an ambulance transporting COVID-19 patients to hospitals and helped dispatch 911 calls due to the high volume. He started feeling sick shortly after signing up for a second 30-day deployment in New York. He was admitted to the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx where he eventually succumbed to the disease.  Cary had been employed by Ambulnz, which deployed 72 employees from across the country, including California, Tennessee and Colorado, to help in New York.  ""Paul’s career is best defined by his kindness and service to others during his time as a paramedic at Ambulnz, and before that as a firefighter/paramedic of more than 30 years with the Aurora, Colorado Fire Department,"" read an official statement from the company.  On May 1, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that New York City was grieving for Cary and that the city would erect a memorial to him.  ""We have lost someone who came to our aid, to our defense,"" the mayor said. ""And there’s something particularly painful when someone does the right thing — a fellow American comes from across the country to try to help the people of New York City, and while working to save lives here, gives his own life.""  ""Thank you to Paul’s family,"" de Blasio added. ""We will remember him and memorialize him. It’s so important to remember this great example of heroism.""  On May 3, the fallen paramedic’s body was escorted by an honor guard and procession — with more than 50 ambulances and first responders — to Newark Liberty International Airport. His remains were then flown to Denver, where a second ceremony took place.  ""He risked his own health and safety to protect others and left this world a better place,"" Cary’s family said in a statement. ""We are at peace knowing that Paul did what he loved and what he believed in, right up until the very end.""  Cary was among the thousands of first responders who traveled to New York to help the city during one of its darkest hours. According to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office, more than 94,000 active and retired healthcare workers have signed up online to help in New York City, including more than 27,000 from outside the state. City officials have stated that the additional help from these workers has been invaluable.  His passing comes as infection rates in New York City and the surrounding areas have slowly declined, even as cases outside the state continue to rise.

3,"The African nation of Tanzania recently sent samples to the WHO for coronavirus testing. Among those items that tested positive for the coronavirus were samples from a goat, a papaya and a pheasant, all at once exposing the total science fraud behind coronavirus testing.  As we’ve warned for over a month, most coronavirus tests produce huge numbers of false positives. The testing kits are largely made in China, and either through gross incompetence or malicious intent, China-made lab tests are notorious for being so inaccurate that they’re practically useless.  Notably, the infamous ""Stanford Study"" which was seized upon by the conservative media to claim that the coronavirus had already infected a large percentage of the population and therefore wasn’t very deadly also relied in China-made antibody tests that produced huge numbers of false positives. Those who touted the findings of the Stanford Study were actually getting hoodwinked by China, it turns out. And similar antibody tests have been run in New York, allowing Cuomo to spread total disinformation to the public, claiming somewhere around 14% of all New Yorkers have already been infected with the virus.  We now have enough knowledge of the ""false positives"" testing fiasco to be able to say, with confidence, that the official coronavirus infection numbers are wildly over-stated. Nowhere near that number of people have actually been infected.  And that means the coronavirus is far more deadly than what people are being led to believe.  Why the coronavirus actually kills about 10% of those who become symptomatic In the United States, the official numbers currently show that 1.35 million people are confirmed as infected, while 80,351 people have so far died from the virus. If you take these numbers at face value, that would put the current Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for the coronavirus at 5.9%.  The infection numbers, though, are wildly over-inflated due to faulty testing kits that produce false positives. If we adjust the infection numbers down to a more realistic level, the CFR jumps significantly higher. And yes, there are likely some people dying from other things who have been incorrectly counted as COVID-19 deaths, but the Financial Times analysis of excess mortalities from all causes ends that argument by documenting a huge surge in recent deaths from any cause, regardless of what’s stated on death certificates.  If anything, the number of coronavirus deaths is being under-stated by perhaps 50% or so, while the number of coronavirus infections is being over-stated by a wide margin.  And we actually have a way to take a good guess at the degree by which those infection numbers are over-inflated.  We already know that many of these kits produce somewhere around 10 false positives per 100 people tested, or a 10% false positive rate (many kits are far worse). We can also intelligently estimate that right now somewhere around 2% of the US population has actually been infected. This is a rough estimate, but as you’ll see below, whether this is 1% or 4% doesn’t change the conclusions by much.  Now, if you test 100 people for the coronavirus, and 2 out of those 100 actually have the coronavirus, but the test kits you’re using have a false positive rate of 10 out of 100, then you will get, essentially 12 positives out of 100.  Notably, 10 of those positives are false, and 2 are real. This means the false positives are 500% higher than the real positives. And if you rely on those findings, you would incorrectly think that 500% more people have been infected than actually have.  This is precisely what the Stanford Study did. They ran tests that produced false positives, then they extrapolated that false finding to the entire population of California. From that, they incorrectly concluded that a huge percentage of California had already been infected, and therefore the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of the coronavirus was very, very small. As we show in this Natural News article, Stanford researchers likely produced 13 false positives for every 1 real positive.  That entire conclusion falls apart when you realize the testing kits they used were made in China. In fact, those particular kits were so unreliable that Stanford researchers tried to hide the origins of the kits in their paper, but internet sleuths found out the kits were actually made by Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, a company that ranked last place in testing kit accuracy. As ExtremeTech.com explained:  At the time Stanford did the study, there weren’t any FDA-approved COVID-19 antibody tests for clinical use. But for research purposes, the team purchased tests from Premier Biotech in Minnesota. Premier has started marketing a COVID-19 antibody test, but it doesn’t create it. The test listed on the company’s website, and that it appears Stanford used, is from Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, an established Chinese lab test vendor.  It also turned out that the Wall Street Journal writer who touted the stunning findings of the paper was one of the paper co-authors who failed to identify his obvious conflict of interest. So the entire study — and the subsequent WSJ editorial coverage of it — was a rigged scam, 100% science fraud parading around as breaking news to try to deceive America into thinking the coronavirus was no real danger at all. It was a propaganda con job, and sadly, most of the pro-Trump independent media fell for it and repeated the bad conclusions, misinforming their own audiences and causing many people to believe the virus was ""no more dangerous than the flu.""  Peak Prosperity also explained this in a detailed video, which I covered in this important podcast:    If you really crunch the numbers on this, it turns out the coronavirus is 56 to 100 times more deadly than the regular flu. But to realize that, you have to weed through the deliberate disinformation being pushed by those who are trying to downplay the severity of the virus for political reasons. (A foolish ploy that will catastrophically backfire when the second wave of infections becomes impossible to deny.)  Bad tests and false positives: The upshot of what it really means So what does all this really mean in a practical sense? Here are the bullet points of the rational conclusions:  The infection numbers are wildly over-stated due to false positives from bogus testing kits. This means the infection fatality rates are under-stated, since far fewer people have been infected than we were led to believe. It also means that herd immunity is far off, since the actual percentage of people who have been infected is much smaller than what researchers have been reporting. In truth, the real number of infections may be just 1/10th what researchers have estimated (or even lower). Any attempt to leap across the chasm and try to rapidly achieve herd immunity in the USA will result in disaster (and mass death). This also means that reopening economies without taking proper precautions — such as wearing masks, which can end the pandemic if just 80% of the people participate — will lead to a catastrophic second round of infections and deaths. Finally, and perhaps most worryingly, this means that people are being told they’ve already been infected and are therefore immune and can go back to work. When, in reality, most of those people have never been infected at all. This will result in many people having a false sense of security, which would likely lead many of these people to avoid taking adequate precautions such as wearing masks. In effect, the result of bad tests producing false positives is mass confusion and the gross mis-allocation of resources to fight the pandemic. If that sounds like the precise scenario that communist China would be trying to unleash across America as part of a biological warfare playbook, you’re exactly right.  That’s why we believe the false positive test kits are deliberately manufactured to be faulty as a way for China to magnify the spread of the coronavirus pandemic outside of China as part of its multiple waves of biological warfare against the West.  Almost certainly, China reserved the accurate kits for itself while exporting known ""bad"" kits to nations like the United States, all while pressuring the WHO to claim there was no pandemic at all."
3,"You’ve probably heard the bizarre claim that hospitals are faking all the covid-19 deaths because they’re being rewarded with extra compensation from Medicare. No one is really dying from coronavirus, the deniers claim, and all the official death figures are simply counting people who would have died anyway, they say.  But there are two glaring problems with that theory. The first and most obvious is that hospitals in lockdown zones (like New York City) have been steadily reporting substantial decreases in the number of covid-19 deaths since about April 10th (see the chart below). If hospitals were faking deaths to collect more money, wouldn’t they engineer the death numbers to go higher rather than lower?  In other words, do the pandemic denialists really want us to believe that hospitals hate money and want less of it?  After 7 weeks of aggressive lockdowns that prevented the person-to-person spread of the coronavirus, New York announced today that hospitalizations have fallen to mid-March levels for the first time since the lockdowns began. On Saturday, 521 people were hospitalized with coronavirus infections and 207 died. These are the best numbers New York has seen in nearly two months. At the peak of the deaths, New York was seeing nearly 1,000 people die each day, and hospitals were stretched way beyond normal capacity.  It turns out that the lockdowns just narrowly averted a colossal disaster of mass death in New York. Had Gov. Cuomo waited even one more week to initiate those lockdowns, the number of dead would have reached nearly 4,000 per day by around April 17th. That’s because the virus was doubling the number of infected about every 3.5 days, which means a one week delay would have quadrupled the number of people infected. And by the end of April, New York would have been seeing around 16,000 deaths per day.  As the record shows, the deaths in New York peaked at around April 10th, which is roughly a 3-4 week lag time after the lockdowns were initiated. There’s a critical lesson in this that many states have already learned: Even after you initiate the lockdowns, hospitalizations and deaths will continue to surge for another 3-4 weeks. After that, the numbers begin to fall off for the simple reason that fewer people are getting infected due to the social distancing lockdown measures.    Source: Covid19.healthdata.org  Are pandemic denialists now going to tell us that New York hospitals are FAKING the drop in deaths? Pandemic denialists are at a loss to explain the drop in hospitalizations since April 10th. Many insist the coronavirus was no big deal from the start, claiming lockdowns weren’t necessary and don’t even work. But if you ask them to offer an explanation of why New York experienced a +299% increase in excess mortalities from any cause, and why nearly 1,000 people were dying every day during the peak of the coronavirus there, and why those deaths have significantly dropped after 7 weeks of lockdowns, they have no explanation that fits with observed reality.  They essentially claim that the lockdowns have nothing to do with the decline in coronavirus deaths. They quite literally believe that the sharp rise in deaths shown above was some sort of random, spontaneous event without cause. Similarly, they believe the decline in deaths also took place without cause. To people who don’t understand exponential math, many phenomena in the world around them appear to be random when, in reality, they all have initiating causes.  Don’t forget that these people claim hospitals are faking all the deaths because they get paid more for recording ""covid-19"" deaths. But if that’s true, then why would hospitals engineer sharp declines in those numbers rather than increasing them to collect more money?  Are these same denialists now going to tell us that hospitals are faking the declines for some reason? But what would be the financial incentive to fake declines in deaths? Or perhaps they’ll tell us that the hospitals have run out of fake deaths to fake…  Anyone can have a theory about anything. Theories are a dime a dozen. What matters isn’t the existence of a theory but rather how well the theory matches observed reality.  That’s why Flat Earth is a theory, but it fails to explain the movement of the sun, moon and stars, as well as the effects of gravity. Similarly, pandemic denialism is also a theory, but it fails to explain the sudden surge and then decline in coronavirus deaths that has now been observed all across the world, in over 100 countries. As documented by the Financial Times:  Excess mortalities in New York City:    Excess mortalities in Italy:    Excess mortalities in Spain:    Nearly a dozen other countries:    Would pandemic denialists now claim that hospitals in Italy and Spain are also being financially incentivized by Medicare to falsely claim covid-19 deaths? Because that would be really be a tall tale.  The spread of a highly contagious pandemic explains all the observed hospitalizations and deaths Clearly, something has been killing people in a huge surge of mortalities, all around the world, all at nearly the same time, racking up death numbers that skyrocket far above typical mortalities.  The pandemic denialists want you to believe that a global conspiracy of doctors, nurses, coroners and hospitals is faking covid-19 deaths worldwide, all in concert, all on command, and that now they are all faking declines in deaths, too.  Occam’s Razor tells is the simpler explanation is probably more likely to be true: The deaths are being caused by a transmissible infection that spread around the world. The declines in deaths are being observed because most of the world initiated aggressive lockdowns to prevent a catastrophic outcome, and this caused the daily deaths to fall over time.  That’s why the deaths are falling: Because the lockdowns were a necessary survival mechanism, and had they not been put in place, the USA, all by itself, would already be seeing something like 25,000 deaths per day (or even higher). By July, we would have seen millions of deaths.  Of course, as we’ve repeatedly pointed out here, we can now lift the lockdowns if people would just wear masks and take vitamin D. We already know that if 80% of the population wears a mask, the virus spread grinds to a halt within just a few weeks. We also know that taking zinc, selenium and vitamin D offer substantial immune system protections that may further defend public health. Yet instead of people embracing these simple solutions to restore our freedoms and economic activities, we now face ""anti-maskers"" who refuse to wear masks, claiming the masks aren’t necessary because, as you might expect, they also claim all the deaths were faked in the first place.  At that point, you have to realize you’re dealing with a kind of shared delusion… a mass mental illness that has ravaged the minds of the misinformed (who listened to Rush Limbaugh and Fox News). If you can’t reason with these people and get at least 4 out of 5 to wear masks in public, the only available option is to re-initiate the lockdowns once the virus begins to spread again.  And that’s probably what’s coming, given that America is now a land of shared delusions and widespread scientific illiteracy. Desperate to deny reality by any means necessary, far too many people have decided the virus faded away all on its own, for no apparent reason, and that it will simply vanish without cause, never to haunt us again.  Stupid-19 has struck again.  America is dominated by superstition, not by intellect America has become more of a land of superstition than a nation of intellect. When the masses have no idea why things happen — or why observed phenomena stop happening — then all events are a sudden surprise. (Which is exactly why the masses get wiped out in every stock market reset that’s actually a mass transfer of wealth from the financially ignorant to the financially prepared.)  It’s a true statement that the world is divided into two types of people: Those who can grasp exponential phenomena (maybe 1 in 1,000 people) and those who cannot (999 in 1,000).  All the exponential events that take place in the world around them — positive feedback loop stock market crashes, the acceleration of gravity, the spread of pandemics and the physics of nuclear fission in a nuclear bomb — are great mysterious to the 999 out of 1,000. The world is a blur of inexplicable events to these people, and they are always behind the curve when it comes to getting caught in a dollar collapse, or a stock market crash, or a pandemic. These people see events as spontaneous and random, when in reality, all events have an initiating cause. Identifying that cause, however, is simply beyond the mental comprehension of these people, so they only see the world as a series of random events usually attributed to luck.  There’s no such thing as luck. There is only cause and effect. Every physical event has a cause, even if those causes are beyond the mental cognition of the masses. The difficulty in all this is that emergent properties of complex systems are extremely difficult to model and predict. Complex systems include things like human physiology, global weather, or the stock market. In these complex systems, very tiny changes affecting inputs can have wildly magnified impacts on outcomes, often due to things like self-reinforcing feedback loops.  Ever wonder why supercomputers can’t accurately forecast the weather just 30 days out? Because there are too many ""butterfly effect"" interactions where very tiny changes in initial conditions produce extremely hard-to-predict final outcomes.  Exponential phenomena are often part of these complex systems, and such phenomena are found throughout nature, in things like the growth of bacteria or the spread of a virus. Because the human mind isn’t wired to accurately assess exponential phenomena — we tend to think in linear terms — almost no one can accurately estimate future outcomes that depend on exponential factors without resorting to mathematical modeling.  Importantly, when the cognitive demands to understand natural phenomena become too cognitively strenuous, people turn to superstition in a last-ditch attempt to explain the workings of the world around them. Playing the lottery might make them rich, they tell themselves, or getting caught in a global financial reset was just a matter of ""bad luck.""  The coronavirus is faked, the Earth is flat, carbon dioxide is a pollutant and ""climate change"" is real. These are all delusional, cult-like beliefs being paraded around as facts when, in truth, they are superstitions that only achieve a seeming consensus because so many people buy into their false claims.  That’s because humanity is a suicide cult, as you’ve heard me say numerous times. The ""suicide"" part comes from the self-destructive nature of human expansion and ecological destruction that eventually turns back on the destroyers. The ""cult"" part comes from the tendency for intellectually suppressed individuals to surrender their beliefs to the consensus of their chosen cult rather than figure things out for themselves. There isn’t one person in a thousand living in America today who can think for themselves, against the cult of the consensus. And this is more obvious than ever, watching the disappointing reaction to the coronavirus pandemic.  Watching conservatives latch on to the coronavirus ""hoax"" conspiracy is just as pathetic and bizarre as watching progressives celebrate post-birth abortions as some twisted form of ""women’s reproductive health care.""  The question for you is: Are you among the ONE, or the one thousand? The ONE is willing to stand for truth against a thousand-strong delusional mob. But 999 will go with the mob because they want to be accepted rather than right. Obedience and acceptance, you see. That’s how nearly all human beings are wired, and that’s why nearly all humans work actually born to be enslaved. They’re wired for it. They have no cognitive capacity to escape the mental prison that has been constructed for them by all the disinfo strewn about by the fake news media sources, which spans all political parties and all industries.  It’s easy for people to chant ""freedom"" at a public protest as long as they’re followed orders and going along with the mob. But that isn’t freedom; it’s obedience and conformity.  What’s far more difficult and rare, it seems, is for someone to demand reason."
3,"Coronavirus test kits in Tanzania have raised suspicions about their accuracy. President John Magufuli expressed during an event that he found them so unreliable due to the fact that certain animals and even a fruit have tested positive for COVID-19.  He further stated that the test kits were imported from overseas, but refused to specify where.  In order to evaluate the quality of the COVID-19 test kits, security forces in Tanzania obtained non-human samples from a goat, a papaya, a quail and even a sheep. The samples were assigned human names and then shipped off to a laboratory to be tested. Lab technicians who worked on the non-human samples weren’t informed about their true origins.  The test results showed that the goat, quail and papaya were found positive for COVID-19, which may have serious implications. According to Magufuli, this means some people could have received positive coronavirus test results despite not actually being infected.  This puts into question the country’s actual number of coronavirus cases. As of press time, the country has 509 reported cases of COVID-19, including 21 deaths. However, the actual number of cases could be higher because Tanzania goes days without providing updates.  A ""dirty game"" is going on in Tanzania’s coronavirus testing lab Magufuli, who initially downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, suspended the head of testing at Tanzania’s national health laboratory on May 4, one day after he revealed that the lab had tested the non-human samples, noting that there was a ""dirty game"" going on at the laboratory.  Hassan Abbas, chief government spokesman of Tanzania, said that the country has formed a team to conduct further investigations on the laboratory that did the tests. They will release the results of their investigations as soon as they are complete. (Related: African coronavirus cases SPIKE by 43 percent – WHO warns that continent could be the ""next epicenter"" of the pandemic.)  ""The equipment or people may be compromised and sometimes it can be sabotage,"" said Magufuli in a speech broadcast through the country’s state-run news outlet.  Magufuli further cast doubt on the foreign aid Tanzania was receiving, saying that it may not always be ""good for this nation"" and that they shouldn’t accept all of it.  Coronavirus test kits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma Africa’s testing capacity has expanded sharply since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the help of test kits procured from the WHO, the Jack Ma Foundation and other philanthropic organizations.  Jack Ma, Chinese billionaire and founder of the Alibaba Group, has donated thousands of test kits and protective gear to African nations. John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said that the Jack Ma Foundation had provided them with a lot of coronavirus test kits.  ""We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries and providing them with test kits,"" said Nkengasong. ""We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.""  Nkengasong told journalists that the Africa CDC affirmed that the Tanzanian coronavirus test kits are ""working very well."" The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed their confidence in the reliability of the test kits.  When questioned regarding the veracity of the coronavirus tests, Matshidiso Moeti, head of WHO Africa, said that the tests procured through their organization and through the donations made by the Jack Ma Foundation were not contaminated with coronavirus.  Magufuli turns to alternative sources of aid for coronavirus Losing any trust he had in the WHO and the Africa CDC, Magufuli has stated that he was sending a plane to Madagascar to collect an herbal mix that the country was touting as a cure for COVID-19. The herbal mix has not gone through internationally recognized scientific testing.  President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar has claimed that the herbal cure, known in the country as Covid-Organics, shows results within a week and that it has already cured two people so far.  Magufuli, in a speech, said that he was communicating with Madagascar regarding this COVID-19 cure. ""They have got a medicine,"" he said. ""The medicine will be brought in the country so that Tanzanians, too, can benefit."""
3,"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is keeping busy scrubbing all evidence from the website of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) that in any way implicates this controversial research institution in the unleashing of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) upon the world.  The latest thing to go is a series of photographs, all of which have been memory-holed, that show scientists at various WIV laboratories working on experiments without proper safety equipment. All references to visits by diplomats from the United States who later sounded the alarm about the school’s work involving bats have also been scrubbed.  This latest wave of censorship comes after President Donald Trump announced that intelligence he has been shown gives him a ""high degree of confidence"" that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic originated at the WIV. British Cabinet Ministers had likewise announced similar findings roughly a month prior to this, backing Trump’s later claims.  ""There are clearly questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus,"" stated a spokesman for Boris Johnson, a British Member of Parliament (MP).  One of the pictures that was removed from the WIV website depicted school staff members entering a cave to take swabs from bats carrying various coronaviruses. None of these staff members were wearing proper protective equipment in the photo, suggesting that they may have contracted the virus from these tainted bats.  The WIV also removed a reference on its website to Rick Switzer, a science and technology expert from the U.S. embassy in Beijing who visited the institute back in March 2018. Switzer had warned the State Department not long after his visit that he observed serious problems with the handling of bats and other related experiments.  ""During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they [the diplomats] noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,"" reads one of the cables that Switzer sent, warning of serious safety failures at the facility.  One refrigerator at WIV holdings 1,500 coronavirus strains had a ""broken seal"" Back in April, British media reported on a photo, also now scrubbed from the WIV website, that showed a broken seal on one of the lab’s refrigerators. This refrigerator was reportedly holding some 1,500 different coronavirus strains, any or all of which could have escaped because of this.  It remains unclear if this is the same photo that was shown to President Trump when he indicated at a recent press conference that he had, in fact, seen ""evidence"" to convince him that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) probably escaped from a WIV lab.  ""I can’t tell you that,"" Trump responded when pressed about the issue. ""I’m not allowed to tell you that.""  Meanwhile, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, representing various three-letter spy agencies in the federal government, issued its own statement indicating that ""the intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.""  Interestingly, the WIV itself admits that the work conducted there is risky. Alongside a website photo of staff members standing next to a communist flag, the institute has published a description of what goes on there indicating that ""highly pathogenic microorganisms"" are handled there, adding that ""once the test tube for storing viruses is opened in the laboratory, it is like opening the Pandora’s Box.""  ""These viruses come and go without a trace,"" a senior British security source added. ""There are various protective measures, but the experimental personnel still need to operate carefully to avoid danger due to operational errors.""  This same official added that the U.K., the U.S., and several other countries are all conducting investigations ""looking at all possibilities"" as to where the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) originated based on this evidence.  U.S. government funded coronavirus experiments on bats captured in Yunnan, located 1,000 miles away from Wuhan Part of this investigation will have to look into the many U.S. connections to the WIV, which, as we’ve reported, include multiple prestigious universities and research institutions, not to mention agencies within our own federal government.  One specific piece of information that deserves greater attention is the $3.7 million granted to the WIV by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct experiments on bat coronaviruses. Bats captured more than 1,000 miles away from Wuhan in an area of China known as Yunnan were taken back to WIV labs where they potentially mixed with other coronaviruses to become chimeras, and where one of these chimeras may have later escaped in the form of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).  This is still speculative, of course, but sequencing of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) genome has already determined that it did, in fact, come from bats living in the caves where WIV scientists had entered unprotected to collect samples. This alone is highly suggestive that the WIV is directly responsible for the release of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) into the general public.  President Trump has since ended all NIH funding to the WIV, even as the CCP insists that all of these suspicious links between the WIV and the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) are merely coincidental, calling them ""baseless conspiracy theories.""  But this can hardly be the case when video evidence has since surfaced showing China’s own government workers admitting on camera that the work being done with coronavirus bats is risky and has the great potential to unleash a pandemic.  ""We can easily get contact with the feces of bats which contaminate everything,"" says Tian Junhua, a researcher who works at the nearby Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, about what he has witnessed as far as bat samples being collected from area caves.  ""So it is highly risky here,"" he adds. ""I feel the fear. The fear of infections."""
3,"People suffering from vitamin D deficiency have a higher risk of contracting a fatal coronavirus infection, a new study has revealed.  A research team from Northwestern University conducted a statistical analysis of data gathered from hospitals and clinics across different countries such as China, France, Germany, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Vadim Backman, a professor of Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University‘s McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, who led the research team, said they were inspired to examine vitamin D levels after noticing unexplained differences in COVID-19 mortality rates from country to country.  According to Backman, while there were some who hypothesized that factors such as differences in healthcare quality, age distributions in population and testing rates might be responsible, their team remained unconvinced.  ""None of these factors appears to play a significant role,"" Backman, who is also the director of Northwestern’s Center for Physical Genomics and Engineering, said. He pointed out that Italy’s healthcare system is one of the best in the world, and that differences in mortality rates exist in the same age groups, as well as in countries that have similar testing rates.  It was when the researchers closely looked at data from patients hailing from countries with high COVID-19 mortality rates, namely Italy, Spain and the UK, that they observed a common denominator: they had generally lower levels of vitamin D compared to patients from countries that had significantly lower mortality rates.  In addition, after further examination of the patients’ data, the researchers found a link between low vitamin D levels and ""cytokine storms,"" a hyper-inflammatory condition caused by an overactive immune system. (Related: New research suggests vitamin D may help combat coronavirus.)  ""Cytokine storms can severely damage the lungs and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients,"" Ali Daneshkhah, a postdoctoral research associate at Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering, said in a statement.  According to Daneshkhah, this cytokine storm is what seems to kill a majority of COVID-19 patients, and not the destruction of the lungs by the virus itself, as previously believed.  ""It is the complications from the misdirected fire from the immune system,"" Daneshkah, the study’s first author, stated.  This is exactly where vitamin D — an essential nutrient often referred to as the ""sunshine vitamin"" because it is produced by the body as a response to sun exposure — plays a major role.  According to Backman, not only does vitamin D enhance the immune system, but it also keeps it from becoming overactive, adding that having healthy levels of vitamin D could protect patients against COVID-19’s more severe complications — including death.  Despite their findings, the research team does not recommend the immediate hoarding of vitamin D supplements on the market — not even to those who are at risk of deficiency.  ""While I think it is important for people to know that vitamin D deficiency might play a role in mortality, we don’t need to push vitamin D on everybody,"" Backman said, noting that the results of their research still need to be studied more thoroughly.  ""This needs further study, and I hope our work will stimulate interest in this area. The data also may illuminate the mechanism of mortality, which, if proven, could lead to new therapeutic targets,"" Backman said.  ""It is hard to say which dose is most beneficial for COVID-19,"" he added. ""However, it is clear that vitamin D deficiency is harmful, and it can be easily addressed with appropriate supplementation. This might be another key to helping protect vulnerable populations, such as African-American and elderly patients, who have a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.""  As of this writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected over 3.9 million people and killed 270,720 around the world."
3,"On Friday, local authorities in Germany said that they would reimpose lockdown measures after seeing new clusters of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections around the country. The new lockdowns come just days after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a gradual reopening of the country.  The reimposition of lockdown restrictions marks the country’s first setback since Merkel announced on Wednesday that Germany’s slowing infection rate and relatively low mortality rate meant that the country could cautiously return to normal.  Germany’s reopening plan Germany has reported more than 170,000 cases, according to data gathered by Johns Hopkins University, as of press time. However, its death rate has been lower than that of similarly hit countries, with around 7,000 deaths reported. This led the country’s leaders to believe that they could slowly begin to lift restrictions.  ""We have a very, very good development of the figures for new infections, and that makes it possible for us to take further steps,"" said Merkel when she announced the country’s gradual reopening.  Germany’s leadership had been faced with mounting pressure from businesses demanding a return to normality. However, Merkel made it clear that there would be conditions attached to the latest decision, and that both officials and citizens alike will need to act responsibly.  ""We must take care that things don’t slip out of our hands, and I have a good feeling because we agreed on this emergency mechanism today,"" she said. ""We are not just saying what we are opening, but also that if something happens locally we won’t wait until it has spread through the whole republic.""  State authorities have the final say Under Germany’s federal system, state authorities are responsible for loosening or reimposing lockdown measures. This has led to significant variations in how restrictions have been implemented, with some states being stricter than others.  With the new reopening plan, regional authorities agreed to reimpose measures for any county that reports 50 new cases for every 100,000 people within a week. Those restrictions can be applied either to a facility – such as a nursing home or factory – if the outbreak is concentrated there, or to a whole area.  The aim, according to Merkel, is to avoid having to reimpose a nationwide shutdown.  Clusters of cases in German states In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, the regional government said that there had been an increase in cases at a slaughterhouse in the district of Coesfeld. A total of 150 among the facility’s 1,200 employees tested positive for the virus. According to local officials, the outbreak meant that the district would have to delay the state’s planned May 11 reopening of restaurants, tourist spots, fitness clubs and larger shops by one week. Citizens would also have to continue social distancing. (Related: Almost 900 workers test positive for coronavirus at Tyson’s meatpacking plant in Indiana.)  Karl-Josef Laumann, North Rhine-Westphalia’s health minister, confirmed that the threshold for reimposing restrictions had been breached in Coesfeld. He stated that the slaughterhouse cluster pushed the infection rate up to 61 infections per 100,000 residents.  Laumann has since ordered the temporary closure of the slaughterhouse and said that employees at all of the state’s meat processing plants would now undergo testing for COVID-19.  The northern state of Schleswig-Holstein also saw a similar slaughterhouse outbreak of the coronavirus. This outbreak pushed the district of Steinburg over the threshold. However, it was not immediately clear what action local authorities would take.  Meanwhile, the eastern state of Thuringia recorded more than 80 infections per 100,000 people in the district of Griez over the past week. The cases centered mainly around residents and employees of six care homes and a geriatrics hospital.  The Thuringian government will be holding crisis talks early next week to figure out how to proceed with the planned loosening of stay-at-home measures in the hotspot.  ""To be clear: We’re not going to put the entire district in quarantine,"" said Martina Schweinsburg, Greiz’s chief administrator. She further stressed that just two small towns were particularly affected."
3,"The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for the coronavirus is currently tracking at over 18% for France, over 16% for Belgium, 14% for Italy, nearly 12% for Spain, 10% for Mexico, about 7% for Canada and is currently at 6% for the USA, according to a comprehensive chart offered by OurWorldInData.org.  The chart, shown below, reveals how the coronavirus is orders of magnitude more deadly than the regular flu, which has a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) below 0.1%, meaning fewer than 1 in 1,000 people who are confirmed and diagnosed with the regular flu end up dying from it. This is confirmed by CDC statistics.  DEFINITIONS: The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is the ratio of deaths to the number of people who are symptomatic and diagnosed with the illness. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) is the ratio of deaths to the number of people who have been infected, even if they never showed symptoms. The IFR for the coronavirus is unreliable because of all the false positives stemming from faulty antibody test kits manufactured in China, which are almost certainly intentionally designed to show high numbers of false positives in order to sow confusion and complacency across America. (Remember: We’re in an actual war with China, and they launched the bioweapon against us. Why wouldn’t they also try to confuse America with bad testing kits, too?)  The pro-Trump media has consistently tried to conflate the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of the coronavirus with the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of the regular flu, to try to dishonestly claim that ""the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu."" Such claims are either the result of 1) Intellectually dishonest people who are trying to downplay the coronavirus for political reasons, or 2) Mathematically illiterate people who don’t know how fractions work.  At Natural News, we have consistently and repeatedly warned that the coronavirus is far more dangerous than the regular flu, and we’ve warned about the complacency being pushed by conservative and independent media, which will result in a second wave of exploding coronavirus cases across the USA. Our warnings have been drowned out by mathematically illiterate (or intellectually dishonest) ""journalists"" who are mostly pro-Trump, conservative pundits who are right now inadvertently setting up President Trump to be utterly destroyed by the second wave of infections and deaths that are coming.  Here’s the current tracking of Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of the coronavirus. Note that these numbers are all low because they assume every person confirmed to have the coronavirus is symptomatic, which isn’t the case at all. In reality, for an accurate CFR analysis, we would have to multiply all the numbers shown here by a factor of something in the neighborhood of 1.4. Note that the horizontal axis on this chart is logarithmic. If you’re not sure what logarithmic means, Fox News has a job opening for you in their science news division.    Source: OurWorldInData.org.  If the Case Fatality Rate for the regular flu were to be depicted on this chart, it would be shown almost touching the bottom line of the chart, at just 0.096% (not even 0.1%, but lower).  Thus, even based on the numbers shown here, the CFR of the coronavirus is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the reagular flu for many countries, including Spain, Italy, France, Hungary, Mexico, etc.  The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for the coronavirus is entirely unknown because of the problem of huge numbers of false positives from bogus antibody test kits. But the IFR for the regular flu is 0.025%, or about 1 in 4,000 people dying after getting infected.  We don’t trust ""infection"" numbers for the coronavirus because there are way too many false positives from the bad testing kits that were all approved by the FDA in a mad rush, even when most of them were so bad they would flag false positives from testing papayas and other fresh fruit.  Global analysis of excess mortalities shows that coronavirus deaths are being significantly under-counted The fact that global coronavirus deaths have been under counted by a substantial amount — as detailed in an exhaustive Financial Times review of excess mortalities — indicates the real death toll from covid-19 is at least 50% higher than official numbers (and may be up to 60% higher).  This the 6% Case Fatality Rate for the coronavirus in the United States is really more like 9-10%. The following FT chart shows the excess deaths from any cause for NYC. Note that it’s a nearly 300% increase in deaths from any cause, regardless of what’s shown on death certificates. This obliterated the denialism argument that claims nobody is really dying from the coronavirus, and that it’s all just people who would have died anyway:    We’ve separately analyzed the numbers over the last several months, confirming that the real CFR for the coronavirus in the United States really is closer to 10%, which means that 1 in 10 people who are diagnosed and symptomatic end up dying from the infection.  The upshot of all this is that as US states begin to reopen their economies and the American masses who have been lied to by Fox News, conservative media and pro-Trump independent media begin to spill into the restaurants, stores and barber shops, a second wave of infections and deaths will once again resume. And the results will be catastrophic for the simple reason that this isn’t just the flu, and it never was.  We’ve detailed the expected progression in this article covering the ""10 Stage of Coronavirus."""
3,"When you see coronavirus cases trending downward in the U.S., it might seem like good news – until you realize that’s only part of the story. While declines in New York, with its huge population, are indeed helping the overall number drop, it’s obscuring the fact that infections are actually rising in many areas across the country.  New York City was hit hard and early by the virus, but new hotspots are now emerging. Several states are seeing surges in cases right now, even as many states continue lifting lockdowns. Nebraska, for example, is not under a stay-at-home order, and infections there have risen dramatically throughout the course of the pandemic. In just one week, the state saw a 57 percent jump in cases.  In Minnesota, infections have been rising as well. In fact, there has been a 155 percent rise in new infections in just a week. In Kansas, the Topeka area noted a doubling of cases over the week before right as businesses started easing restrictions.  In Iowa, which already counts more than 10,000 cases, deaths recently reached a new daily high as cases rose by 42 percent. More than 1,000 workers at one Tyson Foods pork plant in Waterloo tested positive for the virus, amounting to roughly 37 percent the plant’s overall employees. Virginia’s cases, meanwhile, have risen 31 percent to exceed 20,000. Overall, more than a third of states are seeing rises in infections.  And while it’s excellent news to see a 38 percent drop in new infections in New York, the sheer volume of cases involved is making the upward trend in other places hard to see. With 20 million people, New York has seen more than 321,000 cases and nearly 20,000 deaths.  When you look at the five-day rolling average for new cases across the country during the three weeks that began on April 13, the figure dropped from 9.3 to 8.6 per 100,000 people. However, when you take New York out of the analysis, the rate of new cases has actually risen across the country during that period, growing from 6.2 to 7.5 per 100,000 people.  And while it can be argued that greater testing in the U.S. may be contributing to the higher rate of confirmed cases, it doesn’t account for the whole increase. University of California at Los Angeles Public Health Researcher Dr. Zuo-Feng Zhang said: ""The increase is not because of testing. It’s a real increase.""  Model shows just how bad the situation could become in the U.S. A model from the University of Pennsylvania showed there could be as many as 350,000 people infected with COVID-19 before June ends if every state lifts its stay-at-home orders and allows restaurants and businesses to reopen. Should people maintain social distancing and stick to partial reopenings, they predict nearly 160,000 deaths. Even in the model’s best-case scenario, deaths could reach 115,000 in the next two months.  When it comes to cases by the end of June, the model predicted 7.7 million infections if all states reopen, 3.2 million cases should states stick to a partial reopening, and 2.2 million cases if the types of lockdowns we’re seeing now continue.  In terms of the economy, the model is forecasting a loss of 18.6 million jobs by the end of June, along with an 11.6 percent drop in GDP compared to last year if strict lockdowns stay in place; a partial reopening would see 11.3 million job losses and a 10.7 percent GDP drop. Should all states completely reopen, 500,000 jobs could still be lost, and we could see a 10.1 drop in GDP.  It’s important not to gain a false sense of confidence when we see an overall downward trend in cases. When it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, the figures don’t always tell the whole story."
3,"The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) revealed Thursday that China was the source of the faulty coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits received by Tanzania. Prior to this, the origin of the test kits — which produced positive results when using samples from a goat and a pawpaw fruit — was unknown.  President John Magufuli ordered an investigation into the imported test kits Sunday. He stated that Tanzanian security forces randomly obtained non-human samples, including ones from pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, in order to evaluate the quality of the kits. These samples were then assigned human names and sent to a laboratory to test for the coronavirus.  Both the kits from the pawpaw and goat tested positive for COVID-19, according to Magufuli. The lab technicians handling the tests were deliberately not informed about the origins of the samples. Based on the results, Magufuli stated that faulty kits meant were marking some people as positive for the coronavirus even though they were not actually infected.  Africa CDC confirms China as the source of faulty kits Dr. John Nkengasong, head of the Africa CDC, responded to the investigation Thursday. He said that the faulty test kits in question were imported to Africa from China, and then sent to Tanzania by the Africa CDC. These kits were donated by China through the Jack Ma Foundation, a charitable organization founded by billionaire Jack Ma.  Ma, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group and member of the Communist Party of China, has donated thousands of test kits, masks and protective gear to Africa, where the equipment is being used in nations across the continent. Aside from Tanzania, no other African countries have voiced any complaints about the test kits. (Related: Israel’s Health Ministry bans the use of Chinese coronavirus test kits,)  Nkengasong also commented on Magufuli’s allegation that the Africa CDC sent defective kits to Tanzania.  ""We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries, and providing them with test kits,"" stated the Africa CDC chief. ""We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.""  Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, head of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Africa office, also reacted to Tanzania’s investigation of the test kits.  ""We are convinced that the tests that have been provided … both through procurement through [WHO’s Africa office] and those that came through Jack Ma donations, were not contaminated with the virus,"" Moeti said in a teleconference with journalists on Thursday.  Testing lab under investigation Tanzania’s government has formed a team of experts to examine the lab that conducted the tests, stated chief government spokesman Hassan Abbas, and it would relay the outcome of the investigation, once results were in.  ""What the president said was based on initial tests run by using animals … to test the veracity of the test results,"" said Abbas. ""Our worry was based on empirical findings. Once the team finalizes its work we will know the gravity of the lapses in the machines.""  Test issues could affect Africa’s efforts to fight COVID-19 If the veracity of Tanzania’s test on the kits is demonstrated, and the test kits or machines proved to be faulty, it’ll be a huge blow to testing efforts in Africa. While the continent’s testing capacity has expanded sharply, Africa has still only carried out around 685 tests per million people, according to Reuters. In comparison, Europe has carried out nearly 17 million tests, or just under 23,000 per million.  The WHO has warned that there could be as many as 10 million infections in the continent within the next six months. Additionally, Moeti has warned that the disease could ""smoulder"" in the region, becoming a fixture in the lives of Africans for years to come unless governments take a more proactive approach.  ""While COVID-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will [smolder] in transmission hotspots,"" said Moeti. ""COVID-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.""  As of press time, Tanzania has 509 cases of the coronavirus and 21 death, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."
3,"The Trump administration sure isn’t letting a good crisis go to waste as it publicly announces the reopening of society and the economy – under a few conditions, of course: There will need to be mass ""surveillance, testing, and contact tracing"" of Americans in order to proceed.  Speaking to Breitbart News, Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health (ASH), admitted during a recent interview that the federal government is currently developing a massive authoritarian response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that will forever change the way Americans live their lives. Part of this response is to implement a full-scale police state and control grid to supposedly keep tabs on those infected with the novel virus.  A four-star admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (USPHS), the federal uniformed service of the Public Health Service (PHS), Giroir is a top adviser to the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). He’s also a key member of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, serving as its ""testing czar.""  As the testing czar, Giroir has been tasked with heading up the logistics of ramping up efforts by the United States to test more people for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). Since he came on board a few weeks ago, testing capacity has increased from about 100,000 to more than three million, for which he is very proud.  There are ""over three million (tests) as of today,"" Giroir told Breitbart News. ""In the places where there’s a lot of disease like New York and Washington, we far exceed South Korea … We have the most testing per capita of any place in the world.""  Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reveals the Big Pharma plot to enslave humanity by exploiting the coronavirus crisis:       ""Tens of millions"" of people per month will be finger pricked for coronavirus This testing, we’re now learning, is also being expanded in terms of how it’s going to take place. Part of the reopening of America, which is being headed up by Jared Kushner and Trump’s daughter Ivanka, will involve instituting ""wide-scale serological testing,"" which is different from the kind that’s been utilized up until this point.  As Giroir explained during the interview, most of the testing that’s already been done for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) involved looking for the virus in people’s noses, which means they’re actively infected with it. Now, the government will be looking for antibodies to see if people previously had the virus and are now recovered with immunity.  ""The antibody test will get us an idea of if you have been infected in the past and are presumably – not 100 percent certain but probably, by all known medical computation – that you would be immune to getting the virus again at least in the intermediate term,"" he says.  ""It is an important component, but it is not really the whole foundation of where we’re going.""  And just where are they going, you might be asking? The federal government is planning to unveil a finger prick test that will look at people’s blood and determine whether or not they’ve had the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), recovered from it, and developed immunity, all based on the presence of antibodies.  Dr. Deborah Birx, who’s coordinating the White House’s Coronavirus Task Force, is the one who will determine the distribution of these tests, which will be conducted in places like pharmacies and doctor’s offices. And according to Giroir, they will be conducted ""in the tens of millions per month."""
3,"One of the first states to reopen, at least partially, amid the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is Texas, the governor of which announced at the turn of the month that restaurants, malls, movie theaters and a handful of other select businesses would be allowed to resume operations. But some of them are doing so with a catch: Customers will have to first pass through ""airport security-style"" checkpoints in order to enter.  EVO Entertainment CEO Mitchell Roberts told the media that he decided to reopen his chain of movie theaters using similar screening methods as the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in order to earn back the confidence of his customer base, even though Texas Governor Greg Abbott is not requiring this.  Reports indicate that all EVO movie theaters throughout the Lone Star State will require that guests enter through a special cordoned area where they will be asked by employees whether anyone in their households has had flu symptoms in the past two weeks. Guests will also be subject to an infrared temperature screening, and anyone who clocks in at 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher will be told to leave the premises.  Gov. Abbott’s executive order, on the other hand, which he signed on April 28, encourages businesses to merely follow the ""minimum standard health protocols"" recommended by the state’s health department. These include so-called ""social distancing"" as well as ""appropriate face coverings,"" though ""no jurisdiction can impose a civil or criminal penalty for failure to wear a face covering,"" it clearly adds.  As for movie theaters like those owned by EVO, the only other requirement is that they ""operate at up to 25 percent of the total listed occupancy of any individual theater for any screening."" If Texas sees at least two weeks of data showing no additional Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) flare-ups, then capacity will be increased to 50 percent.  However, nothing is stated in the EO about airport-style security protocols, which EVO appears to be implementing of its own volition. It remains to be seen whether EVO customers will agree to comply with these draconian measures or simply stay home until they are lifted.  Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, declares that the time is now to end the lockdowns and initiate the takedowns:    Most Texans are voluntarily avoiding movie theaters for at least the next several weeks It could be that none of this really matters anyway seeing as how a Kickstand Communications poll found that most Texans are not exactly keen on going to the movies anytime soon.  A mere 10 percent of Austin residents indicated that they plan to immediately return to movie theaters and malls, while just over 60 percent stated they would probably go back within the month. Similarly, only about 15 percent are willing to immediately return to retails stores, while 87 percent said they plan to get back to shopping later in May.  ""We do not take these responsibilities lightly,"" added the CEO of Santikos Entertainment, a San Antonio-based movie theater chain that is also implementing airport-style security measures that are similar to those being put in place by EVO.  ""We have been working diligently on safety protocols that will make Santikos a model, not just for theaters but for all businesses on how to open responsibly.""  Santikos is asking all moviegoers if they have been in contact with anyone over the past two weeks who showed symptoms potentially indicative of infection with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).  ""If yes, you will not be allowed in the theater and we will reimburse you your ticket,"" the company’s new guidelines state."
3,"Because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Americans are now dealing with unemployment and food insecurity. At the same time, businesses are struggling to stay afloat and meet the ever-changing demand of consumers across the country.  Coronavirus and the new normal The pandemic has forced businesses throughout America to adjust to the new normal.  Sherry Bonanno, executive director of the Hollywood Food Coalition, explained that the organization had to adapt their practices to effectively help those in need.  The pandemic has caused significant changes in California, where over one-third of America’s vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown. Adding to the pandemic is the state’s currently existing issues of hunger and homelessness.  To address these concerns, food producers, distributors, retailers and advocates are continuously trying to come up with new ways to sustain the nation’s food supply and their own bottom lines, at the same time minimizing food waste and want.  Farmers and wasted produce On March 16, Gov. Gavin Newsom implored restaurants to close. This then resulted in huge losses for the foodservice industry that supplied restaurants and bars, along with schools, hotels, production studios and catering services.  While worried consumers rushed to grocery stores to stockpile food and retail demand skyrocketed, the business wasn’t enough to meet all the lost demand from restaurants.  Scott Grabau, president and chief executive of Tanimura & Antle, a Salinas-based lettuce producer, said that the pandemic has flipped his business upside-down.  Tanimura & Antle grows year-round in California and Arizona but has recently had to stop harvesting entire fields. Grabau is considering planting more iceberg and romaine lettuce, two vegetables that are more popular among shoppers, and less of the boutique leaves offered to chefs.  Meanwhile, Cathy Burns, CEO of the Produce Marketing Association that represents produce companies, explained that crops planted months before based on pre-pandemic demand went to waste because of a lack of buyers. Produce worth billions of dollars had to be tilled back into the soil.  To reduce food waste in your own kitchen, categorize vegetables into groups: Use now, later and latest. Store hardier ingredients towards the back of the fridge and more fragile ingredients near the front.  If you have enough vegetables for at least one week, you can manage the ingredients better. Pay attention to each vegetable’s ""internal clock,"" so you can cook with them before they go bad.  Truckers with uncertain futures According to Zach England, the chief operating officer of C.R. England, a Utah-based company that transports produce and meat in refrigerated trucks throughout California and other states, his company experienced the pandemic’s ""seesaw effect.""  At least 4,000 of England’s 6,000 drivers haul food routinely. The demand for their services skyrocketed during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic when grocers had to work double-time to restock shelves, but the demand has settled down. (Related: Coronavirus infections at meat plants are already leading to grocery shortages.)  Greg Dubuque, president of the California Trucking Association and owner of Liberty Linehaul West in Montebello, shared that trucking companies continue operating in the hopes that the situation will improve soon.  Grocers and employee safety During the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown, shoppers quickly emptied store shelves. Grocers raced to restock, even as inventory was coming in from suppliers. Worried consumers were purchasing four to eight weeks’ worth of food at a time.  These last few weeks, Kroger and other grocers continue to keep stores stocked, even though dozens of workers have become ill. Unions protest that they report are management failures to ensure their workplace safety.  Food banks and hungry citizens The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in the supply of free food to food banks. At the same time, millions of Californians have become unemployed due to the pandemic, with a lot of families going hungry.  During the first three weeks of April, over 265,000 Americans applied for government food assistance under the CalFresh program. The California Department of Social Services, which administers the program, reported that the figure is more than twice the number of applicants during the same period in 2019.  On the other hand, grocery stores are selling more of their stock and donating less food. While restaurants and other businesses that closed had lots of supplies to give to food banks when the shutdown first began, the supply has now petered out.  Advocates work twice as hard to keep food banks operating Bonanno from the Hollywood Food Coalition is constantly working on a new model that will allow clients to receive their food outside in a to-go bag.  Bonanno is also at a loss since her normal supply chains were cleaned out. Pre-coronavirus times, her group often received food from the movie studios, where one day of production on a film or television set results in enough leftover meals for hundreds of people.  But now, all the studios have closed and caterers, restaurants and groceries are providing the Hollywood Food Coalition with fewer resources.  Hope for the future Throughout the American food system, citizens from all walks of life have expressed their fears and concerns. Despite this great need, experts remain hopeful about reducing food waste.  Chris Tang, a supply chain expert and professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, noted that countries and organizations around the globe are trying to think of efficient ways to ""rebalance the supply and demand."" Tang added that efforts must be made to prevent food waste and get the food to those in need.  Currently, producers and those on the front lines of poverty and hunger are collaborating to address this issue. Tang expressed hope that the government and the private sector will work harder to connect the two.  He suggested that California, which has tech hubs and plenty of farms, could pave the way for possible solutions. With a new, nationwide online platform, there’s a chance that those who have access to food can quickly offer aid to those in need."
3,"For months, the establishment has been dishing out a narrative claiming that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a natural, albeit mysterious and unexplained, phenomenon that probably originated at a Chinese meat market. But contrary evidence continues to surface suggesting that the virus actually originated inside a Chinese laboratory and research center.  Many virologists continue to deny this, of course, claiming that there is no evidence to support the notion that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) might in any way be unnatural. But the genetic hallmarks they are looking for as proof may not be as evident as previously believed because modern genetic engineering can be done without leaving a trace.  Believe it or not, a Swiss research team was able to create a synthetic clone of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) in less than a month. And they did this by inserting genetic fragments in such a way that, unless a scientist knows exactly what to look for, would not necessarily be apparent.  Over the past 15-20 years, researchers have been actively studying, dissecting, reconstructing and otherwise tampering with coronaviruses of various types. This includes the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which one scientific researcher describes as an ""obvious chimera,"" meaning it is a combination of at least two pre-existing viruses.  This scientist, who goes by the name of Yuri Deigin and edits the Open Longevity journal both in Russian and English, says that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is based on an ancestral bat strain of coronavirus known as RaTG13, but with a replaced receptor binding motif (RBM) in its spike protein.  The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) also contains an added stretch of four different amino acids that he says were inserted into the virus, creating a furin cleavage site ""that, as virologists have previously established, significantly expands the ‘repertoire’ of the virus in terms of whose cells it can penetrate.""  Because of this, Deigin speculates, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was probably able to mutate and jump species, leaving its original host and infecting humans. And it just so happens that this very type of research was taking place at the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China, which is where the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) originated.  Virologists like Shi Zhengli, Deigin points out, have ""done many similar things in the past,"" including replacing the RBM in one type of virus with the RBM of another. They have also added new furin sites to coronaviruses, creating new artificial species-specific coronaviruses that borrow from other coronaviruses in their ability to do new things.  Now this does not necessarily mean that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was an intentional bioweapon, at least in Deigin’s view. It could be that it was an experiment gone wrong rather than an intentional effort at plunging the entire world into a pandemic. At the same time, it does seem clear that the virus did, in fact, come from a lab, and probably from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Teams led by Shi Zhengli have created at least eight artificial chimeric coronaviruses over the years, and received money from NIH Deigin uncovered that between the years of 2007 and 2017, Shi Zhengli and colleagues created at least eight new chimeric coronaviruses with a variety of RBMs. And in 2019, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) actually gave the Wuhan Institute of Virology $3.7 million as part of a grant entitled, Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence.  That same year, Shi Zhengli co-authored a paper calling for continued research into these and other synthetic viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, arguing that there are ""no clinical treatments or prevention strategies"" currently available with regard to human coronaviruses.  All of this is highly suspicious, seeing as how 2019 was the very same year that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) first emerged in China, and in the same city where Shi Zhengli and colleagues were working on similar coronaviruses. There is little doubt that this chimeric virus originated in that lab, despite continued denial by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  But it no longer matters what the CCP claims as people all over the world are figuring out the truth on their own. It is at least apparent that something went amiss with the containment of this virus, and it is possible that whatever happened was intentional.  Deigin lays out the details from Shi Zhengli’s 2019 paper about the relative ease with which even a graduate student in the field could create such a virus. He also spells out the detailed biology of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) as evidence that it definitely matches the type of thing that Shi Zhengli describes.  Based on the evidence he puts forth, which you can peruse in its entirety at this link, the only logical conclusion is that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is genetically modified and came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He also traces the origins of the RaTG13 strain from which the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was derived.  Amazingly, Shi Zhengli admitted just this year that she was the one who isolated RaTG13 back in 2013 from Yunnan horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus affinis variety. None of this was known, however, until January 2020 when the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) first started arriving in the U.S.  All of this absolutely implicates communist China in the unleashing of this global pandemic, not to mention the NIH that helped to fund this type of research. Heads need to roll, and those who have been victimized by this thing – including everyone who has been forced into lockdown – deserves a full measure of justice.  Bioweapon or not, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a product of China, as well as a product of our own federal government. And both entities need to be held accountable for the roles they played in scourging the planet with this invisible beast.  On the other hand, if it was all just an accident as Deigin believes was probably the case, then those involved need to fess up and admit their error rather than continue to claim that this is all just some wild conspiracy theory."
1,"Pining after a woman it acknowledged it might never have, a frustrated coronavirus particle told reporters Thursday it was not sure how much more it could change about itself to get with local grandmother Beverly Milfay, who received her second dose of a Covid vaccine earlier this month. “I feel like I’ve really evolved a lot, but no matter what I do, it’s still not enough for her,” said the SARS-CoV-2 specimen, claiming that it should have made its move on the 86-year-old last summer when it had the chance. “She’s got everything: She’s elderly, she’s immunocompromised—she’s perfect. But each time I get close to her, she starts putting up all these antibodies. Why won’t she let me in? What do I have to do to get through to her? I worry the only way we’re ever going to be together is if I completely reconfigure my spike proteins and change myself into something I don’t even recognize anymore.” At press time, the coronavirus confided to sources that it hoped Milfay knew it was done fooling around with bats."
1,"After conducting a nationwide survey of distribution chains, the Centers for Disease Control confirmed Wednesday it had traced the slow rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to sweet old ladies who, with their cordial but long-winded small talk, were holding up lines across the country. “We could immediately get another 15 or 20 million doses into people’s arms if these elderly women would just keep the chatter to a minimum and move it along,” said CDC director Robert Redfield, citing an incident in which the queue at a Rochester, NY clinic ground to a halt when Marjorie Bickford, a 78-year-old retiree, yammered on and on to nurses about how there sure hadn’t been much snow this year, and some folks were saying springtime might just come early. “We understand these ladies mean well when they ask our health care professionals interminable questions about whether the hospital is always this busy and whether they like the work they do and whether they have any kids at home. But the fact is, we’ve only been able to administer about a third of our current vaccine supply, and if they don’t cut out all the jibber-jabber about how their grandson Mark is 35 and somehow still single despite having a good job and being so handsome, then hundreds of thousands more Americans will die. Clearly we made a mistake when we recommended people 75 and older be given spots at the front of the line.” At press time, CDC officials confirmed further delays in the rollout were being caused by old ladies trying to pay for the vaccine in pennies."
1,"In an effort to keep the public abreast of the latest developments in the Covid-19 pandemic, CDC director Robert R. Redfield unveiled a list of Twitter accounts Tuesday that Americans could follow to piece together vaccine information. “Following these reporters, medical researchers, and politically engaged musicians will provide Americans with the updates necessary to cobble together some sense of what exactly is going on with our vaccine rollout,” said Redfield at a press conference in which he and a team of the CDC’s top officials shared the list of 25 social media users that included a retired doctor who seemed “pretty in the know” and a 22-year-old influencer from Los Angeles who “wasn’t informational, per se, but was still fun to read.” “There’s this one account called the Moore Institute that seems pretty legit. We don’t know if they’re a think tank or hospital or what, but they get a lot of retweets. We’re also big fans of this Tacoma area mom who shares screenshots of vital information otherwise hidden behind paywalls. Honestly, without her, we’d be totally in the dark.” At press time, Redfield also recommended everybody follow Harry Styles."
1,"As the 10-month-old pandemic continued its rampant spread and the nation’s death toll passed 350,000, top medical scientists attempted Tuesday to convince the American public to take Covid-19 more seriously by issuing a statement in which they patiently clarified the concept of death. “We just want to be perfectly clear about this: When someone dies from coronavirus, that means they’re gone forever, and they never come back,” read the Rutgers University report, which explained that sometimes people who were sick got sick so badly that every part of their whole body ceased to function—including their heart and brain—and that this was a permanent state from which no one could ever recover. “Now, we could understand if you were shrugging off the consequences of Covid because you thought hundreds of thousands of Americans were just sleeping and would wake up eventually. But that simply isn’t the case here. Let’s try this: Have you ever had a pet, maybe a dog or a cat that you loved, and one day it stopped breathing and became very, very still? Maybe you had a little burial out in the yard? So this is the same thing, only it’s happened to almost 2 million people around the world, some of whom lived in your very own community. Notice we say ‘lived,’ in the past tense. That’s because these people are no longer alive. That’s what can happen, and if it does happen to someone you love, you’ll never see them again, and they’ll never see you again, and that will probably be very sad. Hopefully this clears things up a little.” The report coincides with an attempt by top economists to convince Congress to take Covid’s financial effects on the American people more seriously by explaining the concept of people."
1,"After consulting with an interagency panel of top public health experts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday that lead vocalist Vince Neil would be the first member of Mötley Crüe to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. “It’s important that we begin the inoculation of Mötley Crüe on the frontlines of the band, starting with those who have the highest level of audience interaction,” said CDC director Robert Redfield, adding that as frontman, Neil qualified for essential worker status, with the band’s limited success during his 1992­–1996 hiatus from the group proving he was vital to its popularity. “From there, we will work our way through all current and former members, taking into consideration various factors like comorbidities, age, and ability to be replaced by a journeyman session player. Getting everyone in the Crüe immunized will take time, and we ask for the patience of valued members like Nikki Sixx, who based on our criteria will likely fall somewhere in the middle, despite his role as the band’s primary songwriter. While there are clearly many variables at work, we do know that because he is the youngest member of the group and can be socially distanced upon a massive drum riser, Tommy Lee may not see a vaccine until 2022—behind not only his own bandmates but also senior members of Ratt, Quiet Riot, and W.A.S.P.” Redfield went on to say that it should be quick and easy for Neil to receive his injection, seeing as he has not worn a shirt with sleeves in the past several decades."
1,"In a historic moment that marked the nation’s boldest strike yet against the coronavirus pandemic, officials reported Monday that lab assistant Alexander Durell became the first American to receive the Covid-19 vaccine after accidentally poking himself as he prepared a syringe. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t document the momentous occasion because we were still in the back and no one had their camera ready, but here he is,” said Dr. Helen Gigot of Long Island Jewish Medical Center, motioning to the lab worker who managed to inoculate himself when he tripped on a trash can and knocked over a tray that sent the syringe he had just filled with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine flying into his arm. “Despite the many unrelated injuries he incurred from slamming his head on the counter and crushing a tray of test tubes with his hand, the process remains very easy and perfectly safe, and we consider this a success. In fact, after being treated for multiple lacerations and broken ribs, Mr. Durell has been discharged from the ER and is already back at work sweeping up the broken glass.” Durell later became the first American to receive his follow-up dose of the vaccine when he reportedly slipped on a puddle of his own blood, fell backward into a shelving unit, and knocked over several dozen syringes that impaled his legs, chest, and face."
1,"Thanking the many Americans who showed interest in getting inoculated against Covid-19, the CDC announced Thursday that everyone who will receive the vaccine has already been notified. “If you have not received an official phone call or letter by now with the date and time of your vaccination appointment, you can assume that you will not be getting one,” said CDC director Robert Redfield, noting that the application deadline for Americans requesting to be vaccinated against the deadly disease rampaging across the country had passed and all doses of the vaccine had been claimed. “You are more than welcome to join the wait-list in case a vial opens up, but I’ll be honest with you: That’s not very likely. There is hope that we could have another batch of the vaccine by 2024; however, those future recipients have already been notified as well.” Redfield strongly advised anyone who was not currently scheduled to be injected with the life-saving vaccine to shelter in place indefinitely."
1,"Urging the public to have patience while scientists put the finishing touches on the final kickass product, health officials confirmed Wednesday that they were struggling to secure enough dry ice and laser lights for the coronavirus vaccine’s special effects-heavy rollout. “The vaccine rollout relies on a complex supply chain of fog machines and LED projectors, without which we can’t properly melt people’s minds,” said U.S. Health and Human Services spokesperson Harvey Panozza, adding that the department was working in tandem with the World Health Organization to supply the millions of confetti cannons, strobe lights, and fireworks the vaccine’s show-stopping debut would require. “It’s imperative that this rollout rocks the fuck out of every American. Having the laser lights pulse in sync with the music represents the culmination of thousands of hours of hard work that went into developing an inoculation against Covid-19. A majority of people will get a vaccine presentation that features flashy pyrotechnics and a legendary, axe-shredding guitar solo backed up by a full symphony orchestra, which we’re confident will be trippy as hell.” At press time, health experts warned that rural areas without access to professional special effects designers would need to make do with a few lava lamps and a boombox playing Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side Of The Moon."
1,"Pounding yet another Guinness while being cheered on by regulars at her neighborhood pub, Marjorie Davies, a 90-year-old British recipient of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, screamed, “I am immortal!” Tuesday as she embarked on an epic drug-and-boozed-fueled bender. “Nothing can fucking stop me now!” said the inebriated nonagenarian, beginning a debauched binge during which she reportedly punched a Metropolitan Police officer in the face, jumped naked into public fountains, attended her first rave, slept with dozens of strangers, vomited on passersby, and licked every surface in sight. “Holy shit, why on earth did I wait nine decades to try ketamine? I am on fire! Woooo! Anyone wanna drink some of my blood? ’Cause it’s absolutely teeming with antibodies right now!” At press time, sources confirmed Davies had convinced her fellow revelers to keep the party going by hopping a plane to Amsterdam with her."
1,"Vowing to conquer the pathogen once and for all, Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani shouted, “The virus dies with me!” Tuesday while clambering into Georgetown University Hospital’s incinerator. “Take me, flames, and destroy the disease within,” said the former New York City mayor, hopping up and down in an effort to boost himself into the entrance of the industrial waste burner. “Damn you, coronavirus, you son of a bitch—I’ve bested you at last. Be gone!” At press time, Giuliani was shrieking and writhing on the hospital floor after realizing the inside of the incinerator was extremely hot."
1,"Surveying an enfeebled Rudy Giuliani with a mixture of bewilderment and pity, the Georgetown Hospital staff were reportedly saddened Monday by the elderly patient repeatedly insisting he used to be “America’s mayor.” “A lot of people are pretty far gone by the time they come to us, but these delusions are probably the worst we’ve seen,” said charge nurse Daniella Weber, smiling sympathetically as she retied the 76-year-old’s open hospital gown and nodded along to his story about rebuilding his city better than ever before. “Oh God, you hate to witness this. He keeps saying he’s beloved by millions, and it’s just heartbreaking. We gave him a little medicine to calm him down, but he’s still talking about how he single-handedly cleaned up Times Square. He even asked to get the president on the phone. It’s so sad he’s going to die like this, disoriented and all alone.” At press time, a group of nursing aides was leading Giuliani back to his bed after finding the patient holding a 9/11 memorial service in the morgue."
1,"Urging Americans to “smash that sub button” if they’d like to see some real executive power, Barack Obama volunteered Friday to inject himself with a Covid-19 vaccine, eat a ghost pepper, and get bitten by a tarantula live on his new YouTube channel. “Hey POTUS44 followers, Barack here, thank you so much for tuning into my very first presidential endurance challenge, where I’ll inject myself with a vaccine, stick my head in a hornet’s nest, and do whatever other crazy stuff you ask,” said the former two-term president before the 40-minute NSFW video cut to clips of him screaming in pain while sticking 50 syringes into his body, sitting nude in a bathtub with an angry snake, and lighting a roman candle attached to his genitals. “Special shout out to follower @BlueWave60 for suggesting I mix the vaccine with hot sauce first, and to Michelle for getting me this cactus to sit on. And don’t forget to sound off in the comments, because maybe next time, my buds George W. or Bill could be here chowing down 80 raw eggs with me.” At press time, Obama could be seen on the live stream vomiting uncontrollably, begging someone to call an ambulance to take him to Walter Reed Military Hospital."
1,"Revising an earlier mandate requiring Covid-19 patients to self-isolate for 14 days without exception, CDC director Robert Redfield announced Friday that the agency was now offering a new expedited quarantine period of just three to five business days for $29.99. “With the simple click of a button, Americans diagnosed with the novel coronavirus can now get their quarantine done quickly and cheaply for three easy installments of $9.99,” said the acclaimed virologist, stressing that it was important for interested patients to order now, because the exclusive offer wouldn’t last forever. “No more waiting two full weeks for your contagiousness to subside, simply select ‘Priority Quarantine’ on the CDC website and enter your credit card number, and in one week or less, you’ll be fully cleared to reenter society. We only have a limited number of these upgrades available, though, and about 14 million active cases, so you need to act fast.” Redfield added that anyone who ordered the expedited quarantine in the next hour would be automatically entered into a raffle for early access to the Covid-19 vaccine of their choice."
1,"Following reports that the Covid-19 vaccine would soon be available, 39th President Jimmy Carter announced Thursday, “There’s no way in hell I’m letting them put that thing in me.” “Go find somebody else to stick with needles,” said Carter, who denounced former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton’s pledges to receive the vaccine on TV as “completely deranged.” “Those other presidents are fucking idiots. But I’m no rube, and I’m not letting that vaccine near me. How else do you think I’ve managed to stay alive this long? It’s because I’m not a goddamn idiot.” At press time, Carter had pledged that in six months, he would be the only former U.S. president still living."
1,"Begging Americans to just use some common sense, exhausted CDC researchers assured the public Thursday that there had been no indication that the Covid-19 vaccine would shrink you down to the size of an ant. “There’s absolutely no truth to the rumor that the coronavirus vaccine will cause patients to rapidly diminish in size, leaving only their clothing behind them, until they are no larger than a speck of dust,” said CDC researcher Jennifer Martin, rubbing her eyes with her hands and issuing a long sigh before confirming that the required second dose of the vaccine would not lead to patients shrinking down even further until they were able to traverse between individual atoms and become stuck in the quantum realm. “It’s certainly possible that there will be some mild side effects, but these are more along the lines of soreness and fatigue than fundamentally altering the laws of matter, which, again, is mostly the province of science fiction movies and has little to no bearing on real life. This is really just a normal vaccine and we urge everyone to take it. Christ, you’re not going to be able to lift 1,000 times your own weight, it’s just so you don’t get sick.” When asked if there was a chance the vaccine could transform users into a giant oak tree, Martin threw up her hands and said “Yeah, sure, why the fuck not?”"
1,"In an effort to attract visitors to a state that is home to some of the worst Covid-19 infection rates in the world, South Dakota officials launched a new tourism initiative Friday that will be centered around the slogan “Come Die Here.” “For years, people have flocked here to see Mount Rushmore, but now South Dakota is also a great place to just come and die,” said Gov. Kristi Noem in a prepared statement, which touted the dwindling availability of ICU beds, lack of a statewide mask mandate, and opportunity to take one’s last, fluid-filled breaths amidst the scenic backdrop of Badlands National Park. “What could be better than perishing while surrounded by the gorgeous Black Hills after enjoying a scrumptious last meal of chislic or bison burgers? Wild Bill Hickok went down in South Dakota, and now it’s easier than ever for you and your loved ones to do the same!” At press time, reports confirmed North Dakota, Wyoming, and Nebraska had all sought to compete with South Dakota by launching their own similar campaigns."
1,"Stressing that staying home this year had become far and away the safest option available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shut down Thanksgiving travel this week by carrying out major terrorist attacks on all of the nation’s airports and trains stations. “We understand the temptation to travel to see loved ones this holiday season, but it’s important to understand that the dirty bombs and chemical weapons detonated at every major airport from LAX to JFK make travel inadvisable for the foreseeable future,” said Director Robert R. Redfield, adding that the CDC agents had guaranteed the halt of any the coronavirus spread with the additional dynamiting of 50,000 miles of highways, carpet-bombing of all significant rail lines, and placing heads on pikes outside most bus depots as a warning to would-be travelers. “Your safety is our foremost concern, which is why we also recommend that Americans avoid traveling on public transportation, as each and every bus and train has been rigged to explode with C-4 if anyone steps on-board. Anyway, it’s just common sense to take care of yourself and wait to see relatives until late 2021 when the sarin gas clears from your hometown.” At press time, an AP journalist following up on whether healthy, young Americans were advised to travel home had immediately been taken out by a five-kiloton bomb dropped from a CDC drone."
1,"Calling her dinner plan “foolproof” despite varying significantly from recommendations issued by the CDC, area mother Jill Elliott explained several new, wildly ill-informed measures Monday to keep her family safe during Thanksgiving. “I’ve been doing my research, and I think if I sit the whole family at an extra-long table, give everyone their own disposable silverware, and spray some Lysol into the air every few minutes between courses, we should be a-okay,” said Elliott, holding up several bottles of hand sanitizer in one hand and a box fan in the other while listing off various well-intentioned but completely off-base strategies for preventing the spread of coronavirus. “The second people come over, I’m going to open all the windows, take everyone’s temperature, and sit your grandparents at a separate table in the living room where there’s a fireplace, because I heard the coronavirus can’t survive heat. Also, I know we have some people flying in from out of state, and I think as long as they hug high-risk people from the side, instead of face to face, that should stop the spread.” Elliott added that even though she had a fever and a bit of a cough, she was sure she’d be over it by the time her family arrived."
1,"In a major breakthrough that could completely alter the course of the global pandemic, the coronavirus confirmed Monday that it was optimistic a new mutation would be widely available to the public by early spring. “We’ve been working diligently over the past nine months to develop this new strain as quickly as possible, and we’re pleased to share that trials have been an overwhelming success,” said a spokesperson for Covid-19, who stated the general public could expect to see first cases rolled out to healthcare workers and other vulnerable populations as early as December. “Normally the development and distribution of something like this would take years, but thanks to a concerted national effort, we’ve been able to work at a breakneck speed. Naturally, numbers will be limited at first, but by April, we’re hoping this new mutation will be easily contractible across the entire country. And on top of that, we’re absolutely certain it will be available worldwide by the end of 2021.” At press time, the virus spokesperson added it was impossible to overstate how none of this would be possible without the Trump administration."
1,"Shaking their heads in amazement at their failure to see what had been staring them in the face during the entire pandemic, the nation expressed disbelief Friday that they had spent so long overlooking the obvious solution of encapsulating the mRNA instructions for a coronavirus-based spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle. “It’s so obvious in retrospect: You create a mutated form of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2, swap in a couple proline substitutions to trigger an immune system reaction, wrap that up in a few-nanometer-thick lipid delivery mechanism, and suddenly—wham—you’ve got an effective coronavirus vaccine,” said local bartender Sophie Litzman, one of 323 million citizens who slapped themselves in the forehead at their own total idiocy for not immediately shouting out “use a solid lipid core matrix to deliver a messenger RNA-based payload that teaches cells to churn out modified proteins to prepare the immune system for viral contact!” the moment they saw news of the novel coronavirus’s spread. “Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, but I was really just keeping quiet because I thought ‘stimulating immunogenicity through intramuscular injections of a strong RBD-binding IgG with robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses’ was on the tip of everyone else’s tongue. God, it’s just glaringly obvious now. Stupid, stupid, stupid!” At press time, the nation had agreed that this was really a teaching moment that the simplest solution is often the right one."
1,"Clarifying that the federal agency would take a look at Pfizer’s submission eventually, the FDA announced Friday that it would delay the emergency coronavirus vaccine approval until they were finished evaluating a bagged salad kit. “We understand how important it is to get this vaccine to Americans as soon as possible, but we’re right in the middle of examining the ingredients of this Southwest chopped salad kit,” said FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn, noting that he thought it was even a little presumptuous for the pharmaceutical corporation to assume it could just jump the line over an equally important evaluation that would make sure American consumers were in fact getting the tangy chipotle ranch dressing, iceberg lettuce, savory tortilla strips, and zesty blend of Tex-Mex flavors that were labeled on the bag. “We’re only asking Pfizer to exercise a little patience while we determine that this chopped salad does indeed deliver the delicious spirit of the Southwest and contains no artificial ingredients or preservatives. After all, this salad has been in the FDA pipeline for two years. If we were to put off this study and turn our attention to the vaccine, we’d be putting millions of Americans’ healthy, quick to-go meal options at stake.” At press time, the FDA announced it would have to further delay the coronavirus vaccine approval after the agency received a top-priority request to review a new experimental Lunchables pack for emergency-use authorization."
1,"According to a thorough analysis of your inability to form meaningful human connections, a report released Friday found that you were lonely before the pandemic started, and you’ll be lonely after it ends. “An overwhelming amount of evidence indicates that while being surrounded by others wasn’t enough to mollify the deep sense of alienation you felt before the pandemic, there is no reason to believe things will be any different after this crisis is over,” read the report in part, explaining that the pandemic merely intensified your existing isolation as opposed to causing your rejection from society. “Crucially, these findings did not hold true for other individuals. This is reaffirmed by the fact that during the pandemic, your situation has been comparatively much more pathetic than any other person on the planet. So while others can expect to regain a sense of belonging once the pandemic is resolved, you will remain alone.” The report concluded that you would carry this sadness with you forever because you are fundamentally unlikable and incapable of being close to people."
1,"Following reports that he patronized the three-Michelin-star restaurant with a group of at least a dozen people, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California was widely criticized Thursday for eating at The French Laundry when Atelier Crenn offers a clearly superior take on contemporary cuisine. “It’s absolutely unthinkable that the governor would attend a gathering at an establishment that peaked 15 years ago when he and top lobbyists could have dined at Chef Dominique Crenn’s strikingly inventive restaurant instead,” said Bay Area resident Ian Samuels, blasting Newsom for how out of touch he appeared to be with the modern gastronomic landscape. “How can we trust this man to lead us when his taste in restaurants is so pedestrian? It’s upsetting to see him violate the fine-dining standards being scrupulously followed by millions of Californians—and for a completely prosaic and uninspired interpretation of Nova Scotia lobster galette, no less.” At press time, Newsom had issued a scathing review of The French Laundry in response to criticism."
1,"In an effort to clear up any confusion regarding California’s current Covid-19 restrictions, Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law Thursday reclassifying outdoor dining as any restaurant that is located outside. “As of today, any dining establishment whose four exterior walls are exposed to open air and whose front door can be accessed from the outside is considered outdoor dining,” said the governor, adding that the revolutionary new law would allow millions of restaurants to safely open across the state, so long as said restaurants were not located inside another building. “Due to California’s recent coronavirus spike, outdoor patios, updated ventilation systems, and sidewalk service are all of course still encouraged. But remember, it’s perfectly legal to open a restaurant if the tables, chairs, kitchen, and bar area are all inside, so long as that restaurant itself is outside.” At press time, Newsom drew criticism after adding exceptions for restaurants located within other restaurants to open so long as diners were socially distanced and under capacity."
1,"Calling it the “ideal spot” to get intubated for a prolonged period of time, nurse Tamara King told reporters Wednesday that she’d hoped the extra-comfy ICU bed was free when she was admitted as a patient in two weeks. “Obviously it’s not ideal, but when I do get sick, that remote-controlled MedlinePlus has yours truly’s name on it,” said King, adding that she had already called dibs on the bed back in March and was carefully monitoring patients to make sure it was empty by the time an ambulance brought her in. “Look, I’m not saying it’s perfect or anything, but the room has a tiny window, a little private TV, and it’s near the nurses’ station so when I start to code, someone can come and save me. Plus only, like, 10 people have died in it, so it’s still pretty fresh.” King added that if things really went south, she hoped the ultra-spacious mobile morgue behind the hospital had room for her."
1,"Growing frustrated as she tried to figure out what the latest round of bullshit tyrannical restrictions meant for her, local Covid denier Grace Paquin reportedly admitted Wednesday that she was struggling to effectively protest her state’s incoherent and constantly changing coronavirus policies. “It’s just hard to pinpoint one thing to object to when it seems like our officials are changing the rules for the Wuhan hoax virus every single goddamn week,” said Paquin, adding that she and some friends were going to protest the complete closure of restaurants at the state capitol before finding out that they had been reopened for several days. “It’s annoying, you make all these signs that demand an end to our governor’s despotism and attacks on our liberty, but then it turns out the gyms are open again, and you have to throw out a whole batch of signs. I can barely keep track of what I’m supposed to yell at the grocery store cashier—I know they’re taking away some of my freedoms, but they keep changing which ones. Obviously the science around this whole thing is a crock, but they can’t even seem to settle on which things they’re actually going to pretend cause coronavirus. First they said no masks, then masks, then inside was okay, then inside was bad again, then we could see people, then we couldn’t—I wish they would make up their goddamn minds so we knew what in the hell we were denying.” At press time, the local Covid denier was deleting the draft of a long screed criticizing the government for giving away another round of free stimulus handouts after realizing that the government would never do it."
1,"Rushing to assure the country’s populace ahead of the holiday season, experts confirmed Monday that the nation’s virus stockpiles were large enough to prevent any Covid-19 shortages this winter. “Let me be perfectly clear: We have a nearly inexhaustible supply of the virus on hand that will easily last through March, if not much longer,” said CDC director Robert Redfield, telling reporters that the pathogen would first be rolled out to healthcare workers and vulnerable populations this winter but would ultimately be distributed to every American citizen. “We’ve used the months since cases first began spiking in March to accumulate as much of the virus as possible, so fortunately at this point there’s essentially zero risk that we’ll run out.” Redfield added that all Americans could do their part by continuing to go out and socialize with complete impunity."
1,"As the city grappled with measures that would adequately address the infectious disease’s unchecked spread, rising coronavirus cases forced Chicago this week to set up temporary bars in hospitals. “With more Chicagoans testing positive and requiring medical care, we have no choice but to fight this thing by adding more bars and restaurants to the city’s medical facilities, including emergency tents for crowded eateries and transforming wards normally used for surgery patients into makeshift taverns,” said Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, adding that if the number of hospital admissions continued to rise, the city would be forced to put nurses who had tested positive for coronavirus but were asymptomatic back to work taking drink orders. “Of course, we’ll encourage all of our in-hospital cafes, dive bars, and barbecue joints to comply with local mask orders, including having patrons wear your mask when your server is delivering appetizers to your bedside or on any trips to the bathroom that pass by the intensive-care unit. We will also close them at 11 p.m. every night to ensure we don’t spread coronavirus any more than we have to. During this troubling time, we’re doing everything we can, so we also ask everyone to remain calm. This is an emergency situation, and we may run out of critical supplies like tequila and limes.” Lightfoot added that if the coronavirus spread could not be contained, Chicago officials would be forced to turn some of the city’s parks and beaches into pop-up hospital bars."
1,"Utterly disregarding the Centers for Disease Control’s Covid-19 safety guidelines, irresponsible neighbor Edith Bernstein, 94, was having a ton of visitors over to her house, local sources reported Friday. “Who the hell does she think she is hosting a gathering like that while cases are skyrocketing?” said next-door neighbor Laura Perkins, adding that she noticed the get-together after she woke up to blaring sirens and spotted the group hanging out in front of Bernstein’s house next to an ambulance. “Jesus, some people are so selfish. She has all kinds of visitors going in and out of there, and they’re not even trying to maintain proper social distance! Not to mention that an older person in a high-risk category really shouldn’t be letting guests make physical contact with her, even if they are wearing full PPE.” At press time, Perkins had reportedly called the police, hoping they would disperse the emergency vehicles outside Bernstein’s home."
1,"Following this week’s news that the immunization may be 90% effective in preventing Covid-19, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced in an advertisement Wednesday that the first batch of its highly anticipated coronavirus vaccine would arrive in a collector’s edition limited to 2,000 doses. “Pfizer is proud to offer an exclusive early release of our new vaccine in a custom-made Swarovski crystal syringe with a 24-karat gold needle,” the glossy magazine ad read in part, noting that each dose would come in a handcrafted mahogany case and be accompanied with an official certificate of authenticity signed by Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. “The Covid-19 Platinum Edition Vaccine is a must-have for vaccinophiles and sure to quickly increase in value. Act now, and you’ll also receive a leather-bound volume filled with freehand ink drawings of the novel coronavirus’s genome sequence, as well as historic early sketches of our life-saving vaccine’s chemical structure. This legendary piece of inoculative history can be yours for only $4,999.” At press time, reports confirmed all doses of the vaccine had sold out immediately and were now going for 10 times their original price on the secondary market."
1,"Excoriating the presumptive nominee for his lack of action, the national news media turned its ire on the Biden administration Tuesday for its failure to solve the Covid epidemic. “Hopes were high when President-elect Biden won the election but unfortunately at this point he has failed to deliver on his promises to listen to scientists and see the nation through this challenging period,” said CNN anchor John Berman, confirming that thus far, the Democratic nominee had not lobbied Congress or issued any executive actions to address rising hospitalizations or the economic devastation incurred by the virus. “Despite signaling that he would make it a chief priority, Biden and his as-yet-unnamed cabinet officials have acted like deer in the headlights, refusing to put forward any legislation whatsoever despite having at least the House and, pending results, even the Senate in their corner. It’s this type of stalling that just adds more fuel to the fire for Republicans who claim that Democrats get nothing done.” Berman went on to further condemn Biden for his failure to propose meaningful policy solutions to the wave of right-wing violence expected to escalate over the next few months."
