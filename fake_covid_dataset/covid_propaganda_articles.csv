Propaganda,"For months, the mainstream media has been pretending as though it desperately wants to save lives by combating the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) through any means necessary. But once President Donald Trump actually presented a promising solution, they all flipped a switch nearly in unison. According to Attorney General William Barr, news coverage about the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine quickly shifted the moment Trump endorsed its usage, even though Dr. Anthony Fauci himself endorsed the drug back in 2013 during the Obama years when it was used to treat SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), two ""cousins"" of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). ""Before the president said anything about it, there was fair and balanced coverage of this very promising drug and the fact that it had such a long track record that the risks were pretty well-known, and as soon as he said something positive about it, the media has been on a jihad to discredit the drug,"" Barr is quoted as saying. ""It’s quite strange,"" he added. ""The stridency of the partisan attacks on him has gotten higher and higher, and it’s gotten disappointing to see."" What could be the key to quickly getting everyone out of lockdown and back to normal is being vilified by Fauci, the media, and other anti-Trump elements that, in many ways, seem to want the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to continue spreading. After all, if they really wanted to stop this scourge, then they’d be supportive of any possible solution, regardless of who presents it. Describing hydroxychloroquine as a ""game changer"" in the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), President Trump’s recent announcement appeared to shock many deep state hacks who were clearly planning to unveil mandatory vaccinations as the ""solution,"" not some generic pharmaceutical that won’t make any of them rich. This is presumably why he’s now under attack both by the mouthpieces of Operation Mockingbird and by leftovers in his administration such as Fauci. Barr, at least, is thrilled that Trump made the announcement, also declaring his entire handling of the situation to be ""statesmanlike."" On the other hand, Barr stated that the White House press corps has been asking a lot of ""snarky gotcha questions"" to try to derail his efforts. Some in the media are claiming that Trump cited a ""flawed"" study out of France, which suggested that hydroxychloroquine may be effective against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). But this hasn’t phased Trump, who also recently announced that his administration had purchased ""a tremendous amount"" of the drug, which is to be distributed to the states following emergency approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The day before this, White House economic adviser Peter Navarro reportedly got into a heated argument with Fauci over the drug, which Fauci has been downplaying despite his previous endorsements while working under Obama. Fauci continues to claim that there exists no ""strong"" evidence to suggest that hydroxychloroquine works for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and that it shouldn’t be prescribed because of this. ""Day by day there are more articles about the success of the drug in combination with some other drug,"" wrote one Zero Hedge commenter about the news. ""Yes, it may have side effects but it has been in use since 1955 … I am not aware of one article that has spoken about how this drug has failed."""
Propaganda,"In case you have not noticed, the ""old normal"" is never coming back now that the globalists have tipped the dominoes to usher in the ""new normal."" What comes next is a man-made extinction-level event (ELE) that will eventually depopulate the world to minimal levels. Complicit in this conspiracy are bioterrorists from the government, large corporations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), secret societies and terrorist organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), all of which are working in cahoots to kill as many people as possible with deadly ""vaccines"" and other fake medical interventions. Going beyond the Chinese origins of the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) itself, of more pressing concern are the injections being widely dispensed that are reprogramming human DNA and turning people into walking spike protein factories. This is an irreversible phenomenon with deadly implications in the longer term. ""Now that the dangerous and deadly COVID-19 vaccines have gained widespread use, the swiftly evolving worldwide regime defined by the Covid Super Vaccination Agenda will contribute markedly to the ELE,"" warns The Millennium Report. ""Because of the RNA and DNA altering aspects of the Covid injections, these ‘vaccinations’ cannot be undone. Consequently, those vaccinated individuals will either succumb to the ELE or become severely incapacitated to the point of becoming a great burden to their caretakers."" To learn more about the ELE being brought about by the widespread administration of Wuhan Flu shots, visit ChemicalViolence.com. Chinese Virus injections are designed to kill you when the time is right The five key elements to the ELE are the Chinese Virus bioweapon and its associated ""variants,"" chemical-biological aerosols being sprayed in the skies, the military deployment of 5G energy weapons, the annual ""flu vaccine"" program, and the injection of stealth Chinese Virus bioweapons. All of these elements are working together to kill off the vast majority of the world’s population, leaving behind a much smaller slave class that will cater to every whim of the ""elite"" class. This is all in motion and taking place right before our very eyes. According to The Millennium Report, the most important element, and the last to be deployed, is the almighty Chinese Virus injection. This quaternary weapon system is being tested in various forms all around the world from various drug manufacturers with different results. It would appear as though the globalists are testing the lethality of one jab over another to figure out which one needs to be elevated to the top of the heap as the most effective at killing off the most people. ""Coronavirus COVID-19, 5G 60 GHz millimeter wave, chemtrail-disseminated ‘smart dust’ and vaccine-delivered digitized RNA are mutually intensifying quaternary weapons deliberately launched and coordinated to shut down a targeted city or nation, commit genocide, depopulate and / or trigger an ELE,"" the report further explains. DARPA-Big Pharma bioengineers keep themselves busy reformulating ""vaccines"" to make them progressively more deadly. This is what the upcoming ""boosters"" are for, which have absolutely nothing to do with protecting people against Chinese Virus ""variants."" The whole thing is a depopulation scam that, sadly, millions of Americans are buying into hook, line and sinker without a second thought. On the flip side, there does appear to be a majority, at least currently, that is just saying no to the jab, no matter the pressure imposed on them. Will it be enough to stop this heinous scheme? Unfortunately, said scheme is already in motion and will only progress with time. The endgame is total enslavement of the planet under a medical-fascist police state, which we are already seeing take shape right in front of us."
Propaganda,"Scientists initially thought that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), does not mutate as readily as the viruses that cause flu, hepatitis or AIDS. The molecular ""proofreading"" system that SARS-CoV-2 – the virus behind COVID-19 – and its kin use to prevent damaging genetic errors when replicating supposedly made them stable. But these scientists were eventually proven wrong. Several new variants of the original virus have been spotted in different countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil. The mutation appeared to cause major changes to its contagiousness and the way the virus acts in general. ""What we’re seeing is similar mutations arising in multiple places,"" said Adam Lauring, a virologist at the University of Michigan. ""That’s pretty suggestive that these mutations are doing something."" These mutations seemed to make the virus transmit more readily and evade the immune system. (Related: Mutation has caused the coronavirus to become more contagious but less deadly, says new study.) Five most prominent coronavirus mutations In January, researchers reported for the first time that antibodies from individuals with COVID-19 did not completely neutralize a variant first identified in South Africa. A few people who recovered from the disease also appeared to have been reinfected with the mutant virus. According to Scientific American, the five of the most prominent variants discovered are 20A.EU1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P1 and P2. The 20A.EU1 variant, first identified in Spain, contains a mutation called A222V on the viral spike protein. The spike is a component of the coronavirus that binds to a receptor on human cells called ACE2, and this attachment helps the virus get inside those cells and infect them. The spike protein is also the part of the pathogen that is targeted by human antibodies when they fight back against the infection. In lab tests, human antibodies were slightly less effective at neutralizing viruses with the A222V mutation. Over the course of several months, the 20A.EU1 variant became the dominant one in Europe. But epidemiologists never saw any evidence that it was more transmissible than the original. Researchers believe that when Europe began lifting travel restrictions last summer, the variant that was dominant in Spain spread across the continent. Scientists in the UK had been watching the B.1.1.7 variant for some time before announcing in December last year that it might be at least 50 percent more transmissible than the original form. That announcement was based on epidemiological data that showed the virus rapidly spreading throughout the nation. And it led to international travel bans and stronger lockdown measures in the UK. Despite initial concerns, there has been no real evidence that the variant is more infectious in children than the original, said University of Cambridge microbiologist Sharon Peacock, who is also the executive director of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium, a group that analyzes genetic changes to the virus. Both Pfizer and Moderna believe that their COVID-19 vaccines will still work against B.1.1.7. Recent data from the UK hint that the variant may be more lethal than the original, but the analyses are preliminary. The B.1.351 variant appeared around the same time as B.1.1.7, and it spread quickly in South Africa to become the dominant version in that country. Like its European counterpart, B.1.351 contains the N501Y mutation, although evidence seems to suggest the two variants arose independently. But scientists are more concerned about another mutation called E484K that appears in the South African version. The genetic change may help the virus evade the immune system and vaccines. In January, researchers reported they had detected two new variants in Brazil, both descendants of a somewhat older common ancestor variant. Of the two, researchers were more concerned about P.1. That variant contains more mutations than P.2 (though both have the E484K mutation), and it has already been seen in Japan and other countries. Big Pharma may need to make updated version of coronavirus vaccines Early last year, scientists at the U.K.’s University of Bath and the University of Edinburgh said that SARS-CoV-2 is being mutated by human proteins that degrade it, and that ""natural selection"" of the virus is enabling it to bounce back. ""Natural selection – survival of the fittest – is allowing the virus to fight back against the mutational process,"" the scientists said. Professor Laurence Hurst, director of the Milner Center for Evolution at the University of Bath, said: ""I have looked at mutational profiles for many organisms and they all show some sort of bias, but I’ve never seen one as strong and strange as this."" The scientists noted that all organisms mutate but this is usually a random process as a result of mistakes made when DNA is copied. ""In the case of SARS-CoV-2, mutation may well not be a random process and that instead humans are mutating it, as part of a defense mechanism to degrade the virus,"" the scientists explained. According to the scientists, the results of possible mutations could have implications for vaccine design. ""Knowing what selection favors and disfavors in the virus is really helpful in understanding what an attenuated version should look like,"" said Hurst. Vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer seem to work against the new variants, although Moderna has started developing a booster shot specific to new variants. Experts said a slight drop in effectiveness would still make both vaccines worth using because they showed more than 90 percent effectiveness in trials. ""I’m optimistic this won’t compromise the [COVID vaccines], but obviously, it’s something we’ve got to watch closely,"" Lauring said, adding that companies may need to retool these vaccines and administer updated versions in the coming years, much in the same way that flu vaccines are revised each year."
Propaganda,"Walker says that Directed Evolution is different than Gain-of-Function, which is defined as ""a mutation that confers new or enhanced activity on a protein."" In other words, it means that a virus such as COVID can become more potent depending on the mutation / scientific experiment performed on it.  The Pfizer executive told a Veritas journalist about his company’s plan for COVID vaccines, while acknowledging that people would not like this information if it went public.  ""One of the things we [Pfizer] are exploring is like, why don’t we just mutate it [COVID] ourselves so we could create — preemptively develop new vaccines, right? So, we have to do that. If we’re gonna do that though, there’s a risk of like, as you could imagine — no one wants to be having a pharma company mutating f**king viruses,"" Walker said.  ""From what I’ve heard is they [Pfizer scientists] are optimizing it [COVID mutation process], but they’re going slow because everyone is very cautious — obviously they don’t want to accelerate it too much. I think they are also just trying to do it as an exploratory thing because you obviously don’t want to advertise that you are figuring out future mutations,"" he said.  ""Don’t tell anyone. Promise you won’t tell anyone. The way it [the experiment] would work is that we put the virus in monkeys, and we successively cause them to keep infecting each other, and we collect serial samples from them.""  Walker drew parallels between this current Pfizer project and what may have happened at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.  ""You have to be very controlled to make sure that this virus [COVID] that you mutate doesn’t create something that just goes everywhere. Which, I suspect, is the way that the virus started in Wuhan, to be honest. It makes no sense that this virus popped out of nowhere. It’s bullsh*t,"" he said.  ""You’re not supposed to do Gain-of-Function research with viruses. Regularly not. We can do these selected structure mutations to make them more potent. There is research ongoing about that. I don’t know how that is going to work. There better not be any more outbreaks because Jesus Christ,"" he said.  Walker also told the Veritas journalist that COVID has been instrumental for Pfizer’s recent business success:  Walker:Part of what they [Pfizer scientists] want to do is, to some extent, to try to figure out, you know, how there are all these new strains and variants that just pop up. So, it’s like trying to catch them before they pop up and we can develop a vaccine prophylactically, like, for new variants. So, that’s why they like, do it controlled in a lab, where they say this is a new epitope, and so if it comes out later on in the public, we already have a vaccine working.  Veritas Journalist:Oh my God. That’s perfect. Isn’t that the best business model though? Just control nature before nature even happens itself? Right?  Walker:Yeah. If it works.  Veritas Journalist:What do you mean if it works?  Walker:Because some of the times there are mutations that pop up that we are not prepared for. Like with Delta and Omicron. And things like that. Who knows? Either way, it’s going to be a cash cow. COVID is going to be a cash cow for us for a while going forward. Like obviously.  Veritas Journalist:Well, I think the whole research of the viruses and mutating it, like, would be the ultimate cash cow.  Walker:Yeah, it’d be perfect.  Walker went on to explain how Big Pharma and government officials, such as at the Food & Drug Administration [FDA], have mutual interests, and how that is not in the best interest of the American people:  Walker:[Big Pharma] is a revolving door for all government officials.  Veritas Journalist:Wow.  Walker:In any industry though. So, in the pharma industry, all the people who review our drugs — eventually most of them will come work for pharma companies. And in the military, defense government officials eventually work for defense companies afterwards.  …  Veritas Journalist:How do you feel about that revolving door?  Walker:It’s pretty good for the industry to be honest. It’s bad for everybody else in America.  Veritas Journalist:Why is it bad for everybody else?  Walker:Because when the regulators reviewing our drugs know that once they stop regulating, they are going to work for the company, they are not going to be as hard towards the company that’s going to give them a job."
Propaganda,"Discussing a New England Journal of Medicine article authored by FDA vaccine advisory panelist Dr. Paul Offit, NBC covers his view the jabs should be reserved for older or immunocompromised people as their development is failing to keep up with evolving Covid variants. From NBC‘s report, ""Younger, healthy people don’t need another Covid booster, vaccine expert says,""  A key adviser to the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine panel is questioning whether more Covid booster shots are necessary for healthy, younger people.  The evidence for the new versions of the vaccines for the omicron variant of the coronavirus, which the FDA authorized in August, is ""underwhelming"" and fails to show they are much better than the original shots, Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician who is a leading vaccine and infectious diseases expert, wrote Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Protecting people against Covid infection with the current mRNA technology may be a pipe dream, especially as new coronavirus strains emerge every few months, Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told NBC News.  The updated boosters from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are probably best reserved for people at high risk of severe illness or death from Covid — older adults, people with multiple coexisting conditions and those who are immunocompromised, Offit said.  Asking young, healthy people who have a lower risk of serious illness to get boosted with a variant-specific vaccine, followed by a different variant-specific formula a few months later, may not be practical, he said.  In his NEJM paper, Offit claimed the jabs offer some protection against severe infection, however went on to say boosting against specific strains that ""might disappear in a few months"" is essentially useless for young, healthy people.  Although boosting with a bivalent vaccine is likely to have a similar effect as boosting with a monovalent vaccine, booster dosing is probably best reserved for the people most likely to need protection against severe disease — specifically, older adults, people with multiple coexisting conditions that put them at high risk for serious illness, and those who are immunocompromised. In the meantime, I believe we should stop trying to prevent all symptomatic infections in healthy, young people by boosting them with vaccines containing mRNA from strains that might disappear a few months later.  To his credit, Offit, a staunch vaccine and social distancing advocate who frequently appears on CNN, has been against the FDA’s booster scheme since early on and has been appearing on mainstream media to promote his theory boosters don’t benefit young, healthy people.  On the other hand, Infowars has shown evidence from various sources that the jabs actually appear to be weakening, suppressing and destroying the immune system, making the boosters highly questionable even for elderly and immunocompromised individuals.  Entrepreneur Steve Kirsch argues Offit’s booster jab skepticism was evidence enough no one should be taking them, saying, ""One of the world’s most respected vaccinologists admits that there are no benefits to the boosters. He’s not taking the boosters. Why should you?"""
Propaganda,"The health board for Nevada’s Elko County voted to defer banning the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and flu vaccines in the county. Members of the board unanimously agreed that they lacked authority to impose such ban.  But they’re also not forcing people to get vaccinated.  ""It’s important for us to remember that people need to be in charge of their own health care from the beginning,"" said Commissioner Delmo Andreozzi, a member of the health board. Elko County Health Officer Dr. Bryce Putnam, also a member of the health board, noted that receiving a vaccine is a personal choice even though he himself is a profound advocate for vaccination.  Commissioner Rex Steninger agreed with his colleagues. ""We can’t order people to wear masks. I feel the same way about this moratorium,"" he said. ""If somebody wants to take the vaccine, that’s their decision.""  County commissioners earlier took hard stances against what they considered ""government overreach."" They voted to disregard a mask mandate reimposed in August 2021 by former Gov. Steve Sisolak to curb the spread of the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. They also banned the use of vaccine passports by any county agency in July 2021, and unanimously rejected a $500,000 grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in November 2022.  During the board’s Jan. 18 meeting, they also voted against a ""discussion and consideration of a request to discontinue local advertising for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines pending further investigation and results of the Florida Supreme Court case to investigate the wrongdoing related to COVID-19 vaccines.""  Back in December, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis requested the Sunshine State’s high court convene a grand jury to investigate any possible side effects of COVID-19 vaccines and to get more information from pharmaceutical companies. (Related: DeSantis pushes to remove vaccine mandates, allow vaccine-injured to sue for damages.)  Elko County Commissioner Jon Karr, a member of the health board, said the vaccine-related items should not even be on the agenda as they do not put the county in a positive light.  ""Our legal already said, ‘You can go ahead and do that,'"" he told 2News. ""You don’t have any right to tell the hospital, ‘Don’t do a vaccine’ or, all of a sudden, you can’t tell the radio stations they can’t advertise. We don’t have that authority anyway.""  According to Karr, a concerned resident spoke about possible problems with vaccines – including heart problems and cardiac inflammation. The said resident cited DeSantis’ efforts to investigate COVID-19 vaccines.  ACLU’s threat may have played a role in the vote Threat of legal action from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada also played a role in the vote. The civil rights nonprofit penned a letter for the health board, warning that it would file a lawsuit if members proceed with a moratorium on the COVID-19 and flu vaccines, as well as their marketing.  ""A moratorium on vaccinations would be an egregious injustice,"" ACLU representatives said in the letter. ""Whether those in Elko [County] take advantage of influenza or COVID vaccines, offered readily throughout the country, is not your decision.""  Because of this, the health board rejected the proposed bans despite support from a majority of community members who testified during public comment."
Propaganda,"German authorities want to put a famous Jewish composer and Holocaust survivor into a psychiatric clinic and force her to take the COVID injection.  (Article by Andreas Wailzer republished from LifeSiteNews.com)  Inna Zhvanetskaya, who lives in Stuttgart, Germany, was supposed to be taken to a psychiatric institution and forcefully injected with the COVID jabs on January 11, according to the news outlet Report24, which has been in personal contact with Zhvanetskaya.  However, according to several reports, she has been transferred to a safe place by friendly activists who wanted to prevent her arrest.  The 85-year-old Zhvanetskaya sent a video message to Report24 saying that ""music is my life, and if they take away music from me then they take my life.""  Report24 also received a copy of the court order, which authorizes her forceful transfer to a psychiatric institution and for her to be forcefully injected with the COVID-19 shots ""for her own good.""  The court order was officially appointed by her professional guardian, which seems somewhat contradictory given that the German national federation of professional guardians is strictly against forced vaccinations of patients against their wishes, according to statements made on their website.  The court order claims that Zhvanetskaya has been diagnosed with several mental illnesses, including dementia, delusional disorder, narcissistic ""grandeur self-image,"" egocentrism and logorrhea. She also allegedly suffers from severe obesity and heart disease.  However, many of these diagnoses were called into question by critics after the story made the rounds in alternative media circles. Report24 journalist Will Huber pointed out that Zhvanetskaya does not appear to be extremely overweight in the video she sent, which seems to contradict the claim that she is severely obese.  Mascha Orel, co-founder of a humanitarian organization for holocaust survivors, reportedly spoke with Zhvanetskaya and said she cannot confirm any of the diagnoses that were alleged in the court order.  ""I talked to her on the phone for an hour,"" Orel said, according to a report by TKP. ""She is vulnerable, frightened, and has lived in this state for about two years, as her legal guardian has apparently tried to institutionalize her several times.""  ""She drew an unequivocal comparison: ‘It’s like when Dad was at the front and Mom had to flee with me and my brother.’""  Orel said that Zhvanetskaya is introverted and autistic but added that this is ""normal for a highly talented artist.""  Orel also mentioned that Zhvanetskaya did not want to take her medication at one point and that this was likely a reason for her legal guardian to call for her to be institutionalized.  Zhvanetskaya’s father, who was a doctor, ""probably also taught her to weigh the benefits and risks. She has a very conscious approach to the subject and that is probably why she refused the vaccination so staunchly,"" Orel said.  Another interesting detail about the court order is the fact that it claims Zhvanetskaya’s birthday is on January 20, 1939, even though all other sources say that she was born in 1937.  Many lawyers, activists, doctors, and alternative media outlets have come to the defense of Zhvanetskaya and have blasted the action taken by German authorities.  ""This decision is a gigantic judicial scandal,"" lawyer and expert for medical law Beate Bahner wrote in a Telegram post.  Professor Martin Haditsch, who was one of Austria’s most famous critics of the COVID-related government measures, said that the forced vaccination represents a violation of the Nuremberg Code, which forbids medical experiments on humans since the COVID injections were not properly tested before being introduced to the market.  Zhvanetskaya’s lawyer, Holger Fischer, who appealed the court order, gave an update on his Telegram channel on January 12, saying the district court of Stuttgart granted his urgent application to suspend the compulsory vaccination until the decision on the appeal is made. However, Zhvanetskaya could still be forcefully institutionalized at any point, according to Fischer.  The Jewish composer was born in 1937 in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. The city was occupied by Nazi Germany between July 1941 and March 1944. She created numerous works of classical music throughout her career that were played by orchestras around the world."
Propaganda,"A noted lawmaker said China was clear about its biological weapons ambitions long before the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak that turned into a global pandemic.  Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, along with other Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), have released a report about the origins of the viral outbreak.  ""Our State Department has put things out over the past, even going back to 2005, that China is interested in offensive bioweapons,"" Wenstrup told the ""Capitol Report"" program on NTD, the sister media outlet of the Epoch Times, on Dec. 16 – two days after the report was published.  The Ohio Republican pointed to research done by the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Fifth Institute of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), which is the top medical research organization for the Chinese military.  ""In 2005, the U.S. State Department publicly stated the U.S. assessment that China also operates an offensive biological weapons program, specifically identifying two Chinese entities as likely involved, one of which is the Fifth Institute. In a 2006 declaration of compliance with the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention, China acknowledged that the Fifth Institute specifically conducts research on SARS coronaviruses,"" the report noted.  ""Indeed, a review of academic research on the PubMed database maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health shows Fifth Institute scientists have extensively published research on coronaviruses, including work conducted with researchers at the WIV (Wuhan Institute of Virology). In short, the AMMS’ Fifth Institute has a long history with China’s bioweapons program, coronaviruses, and the WIV.""  In his interview, Wenstrup also noted a book titled ""The Unnatural Origin of SARS and New Species of Artificial Humanized Viruses as Genetic Weapons,"" which was released by AMMS in 2015.  ""The book described how to create weaponized chimeric SARS coronaviruses, the potentially broader scope for their use compared to traditional bioweapons, and the benefits of being able to plausibly deny that such chimeric coronaviruses were artificially created rather than naturally occurring,"" the report noted.  Wenstrup, who is also a medical doctor, said that the ChiCom military research center collaborated with the WIV, the facility at the center of the theory that COVID-19 was developed and then accidentally leaked or was purposely released.  ""The central premise of the AMMS book is that SARS-CoV-1, the strain of coronavirus that caused the 2002 SARS outbreak, did not emerge naturally but was a chimeric virus artificially engineered as a genetic weapon to infect humans,"" the congressional report stated.  ""The book described the PLA researchers’ broader belief that other nations are developing chimeric coronaviruses to use as genetic weapons. The authors described how to create weaponized chimeric SARS coronaviruses, the potentially broader scope for their use compared to traditional bioweapons, and the benefits of being able to plausibly deny that such chimeric coronaviruses were artificially created rather than naturally occurring.""  Wenstrup mentioned a scientist with the Chinese military’s Fifth Institute, General Zhou Yusen, who may have worked with the WIV for years before the pandemic. Wenstrup said that Zhou was ""heavy into the gain of function type research or chimeric research,"" which is believed to have created COVID-19.  ""Notably, in the spring of 2020, as global COVID-19 cases surpassed seven million and COVID-19 deaths surpassed 400,000, General Zhou reportedly died under mysterious circumstances,"" according to the GOP report.  There’s little doubt that China was responsible for creating and spreading COVID-19. This latest report merely confirmed that belief while adding many new details."
Propaganda,"Twitter CEO Elon Musk blasted President Joe Biden’s outgoing Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci on Wednesday, December 28, for overseeing the creation of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) bioweapon that has killed millions around the world.  ""Important to note that Fauci authored a 2012 paper arguing for gain-of-function research,"" Musk tweeted. He then cited an article published by Yahoo on March 2021, where Fauci backed the gain-of-function experiments based on his paper written back in 2012.  According to Fauci, the research is ""important work"" and the benefits of such experiments as well as the resulting knowledge outweigh the risks.  ""Some good nuggets in the article. ‘Gain-of-function‘ in this context is just another way of saying ‘bioweapon,'"" the tech mogul pointed out.  In the paper, the retiring National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director said such research involves making viruses more infectious and/or deadly.  A lot of experts have been coming out with analyses that found the possibility of COVID-19 to have originated from a potential lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in Wuhan, China, where gain-of-function experiments on bat coronaviruses had been conducted.  Musk noted that former President Barack Obama ""wisely put this on pause, but Fauci restarted it."" In 2014, the Obama administration paused funding for gain-of-function experiments in 22 fields, including those involving SARS, influenza and MERS because of the increased risk such experimentation carries of causing a pandemic.  When Fauci wrote the paper supporting gain-of-function research, there was a voluntary ban on such experiments related to highly infectious influenza viruses. Yet the EcoHealth Alliance diverted $600,000 in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the head agency of NIAID, to the WIV in the form of sub-grants from 2014 through 2019 to study bat coronaviruses.  Fauci maintained that no U.S. funding went to WIV for gain-of-function research, but conceded during congressional testimony last year that it was impossible to guarantee that researchers at the WIV did not use American funds to perform gain-of-function research on coronaviruses. (Related: Fauci ""knew"" he was funding illegal gain-of-function research, says former CDC director.)  Musk hints Fauci needs to be prosecuted Musk also took a swipe on Fauci earlier in December, saying: ""My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci."" While the post did not include context, it still drew support from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.  Also, Twitter user @hodgetwins replied to Musk’s tweet: ""Let me guess. You found messages between Twitter execs and our government (Fauci and team) pushing for censorship of anyone that didn’t go along with their narrative on COVID?"" Musk responded with a trophy emoticon. He also replied with a simple ""Yes"" when another user inquired if this will be explained in the next set of Twitter Files.  While Musk’s tweet acquired roughly half a million likes in its first few hours online, the post also received backlash. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist and virology professor, defended Fauci’s work at the forefront of U.S. pandemic mitigation efforts and urged Musk to remove the post.  ""For the record: Dr. Fauci has done nothing wrong, except serve our nation. In the meantime, Mr. Musk should know that 200,000 Americans needlessly lost their lives from COVID due to this kind of antiscience rhetoric and disinformation. Elon, I’m asking you to take down this Tweet,"" Hotez wrote. Musk has not responded publicly.  About an hour before posting the tweet about Fauci, Musk shared a meme with a caption that read in part, ""Just one more lockdown,"" which could be interpreted as an allusion to Fauci’s advocacy for safety mandates that public health experts, including those in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, agreed were helpful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 before vaccines became widely available."
Propaganda,"People who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19 face a substantially higher risk of getting in a car crash than vaccinated people, which could justify higher insurance rates for the unvaccinated, according to a study published this month in The American Journal of Medicine.  (Article republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org)  The study didn’t find that being unvaccinated causes traffic accidents. Instead, the researchers postulated that there is a psychological reason why ""vaccine hesitant"" people ""might also neglect basic road safety guidelines.""  John Campbell, Ph.D., a nurse educator, and comedian and political commentator Russell Brand were among the critics who took issue with the study, citing its flaws and questioning the motives behind doing such a study.  Others were more blunt. Norman Fenton, Ph.D., a professor of risk information management at Queen Mary London University, accused the journal of publishing ""a study in stupidity.""  Dr. Vinay Prasad, a hematologist-oncologist at the University of California San Francisco tweeted:   Researchers investigated correlation — not causation  The study’s authors analyzed encrypted government data from 178 Ontario medical centers and more than 11.2 million residents of the province, of whom 84% had received a COVID-19 vaccine and 16% had not as of July 31, 2021.  Among the study cohort, 6,682 people needed emergency care because they were involved in a serious car accident — either as a driver, a passenger or a pedestrian — during the one-month period the researchers analyzed.  Unvaccinated people accounted for 25% of the traffic accidents (1,682 cases), meaning they had a 72% increased risk of accidents relative to those who had taken the jab.  When researchers adjusted for other variables such as age, sex, socioeconomic status and other medical conditions, the relative increased risk for the unvaccinated dropped to 48%.  The researchers said their findings are significant because, ""A relative risk of this magnitude … exceeds the safety gains from modern automobile engineering advances and also imposes risks on other road users.""  Although the authors noted the study did not investigate or demonstrate any causal link between being unvaccinated and risky driving, they proposed several possible causes for the correlation they found.  They thought there could be ""a distrust of government or belief in freedom that contributes to both vaccination preferences and increased traffic risks.""  Other explanations, the researchers said, might be ""misconceptions of everyday risks, faith in natural protection, antipathy toward regulation, chronic poverty, exposure to misinformation, insufficient resources, or other personal beliefs.""  The authors concluded that ""COVID vaccine hesitancy is associated with significant increased risks of a traffic crash. An awareness of these risks might help to encourage more COVID vaccination.""  ‘This is ludicrous’  The researchers did not address numerous limitations in the data they presented, according to Campbell, who provided a full analysis of the study.  ""The obvious response to that is to say, well this is ludicrous, which it is, but … [the] evidence needs to be unpacked,"" said Campbell, an expert on vaccine administration.  During the study period, the unvaccinated were more likely to drive — and therefore at higher risk for accidents — yet the study did not account for differences in miles driven.  In Canada, for much of 2021, unvaccinated people could not use public transportation, which would have compelled them to drive more. Essential workers in non-healthcare settings who had to commute to work lived in neighborhoods with higher rates of COVID-19 and lower vaccination rates. Vaccinated people were more likely to work remotely or to be retired.  Contrary to the study’s implication that people in accidents were practicing ""risky driving,"" most cases were actually passengers or pedestrians. Of the 6,682 crashes, only 2,856 of those cases were drivers — 1,189 were passengers and 2,637 were pedestrians, whose accidents did not result from their driving practices.  Campbell reported that the study classified people as unvaccinated for 14 days after vaccination.  Given that the study lasted only a month, vaccinated people could have been characterized as unvaccinated for up to half of the study. If 602 people were misclassified in this way, the difference between the two groups disappears.  All deaths at the scene were excluded. If a cardiac or other event — possibly vaccine-related — caused the accident, it was not included in the study, Campbell said.  Major statistical flaws make study ‘a joke’  In a Twitter thread, Dr. Claire Craig, with the U.K.’s Queen’s College, University of Oxford, called the study ""a joke,"" pointing to major statistical flaws.  The researchers undercounted unvaccinated people because they compared two sets of data — the number of people who went to the hospital after an accident and the number of people in the government vaccination database. They did not account for unvaccinated people who are not in the government vaccination databases, Craig said.  Undercounting unvaccinated people skewed the numbers so it appeared that unvaccinated people were at consistently higher risk for every condition they measured for, according to Craig.  She concluded:   Health data and the rise of biodigital surveillance  According to the study footnotes, the researchers accessed a large government dataset held at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, which they used to analyze risk by correlating vaccination status with socioeconomic information, detailed healthcare records and other data.  They concluded that ""The observed risks might also justify changes to driver insurance policies in the future.""  According to a recent investigation by ProPublica, health insurance companies are increasingly collecting vast amounts of information to determine insurance costs on an individual basis.  ProPublica reported:  ""With little public scrutiny, the health insurance industry has joined forces with data brokers to vacuum up personal details about hundreds of millions of Americans, including, odds are, many readers of this story.  ""The companies are tracking your race, education level, TV habits, marital status, net worth. They’re collecting what you post on social media, whether you’re behind on your bills, what you order online.  ""Then they feed this information into complicated computer algorithms that spit out predictions about how much your health care could cost them.""  Companies outside the narrow scope of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which prohibits healthcare providers from disclosing protected patient information — from data brokers to period-tracking apps — can and do legally sell people’s health-related information, from information about their surgical procedures to their mental health conditions.  These practices can help the industry boost profits by avoiding coverage for sick people.  But they are also part of a broader trend toward digital surveillance and control through the mass collection of people’s personal data and the creation of digital IDs.  Plans for digital IDs have been in the works for several years, but they gained traction during the pandemic.  The ID2020 Alliance, founded in 2016 with seed money from Microsoft Accenture, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Rockefeller Foundation, Cisco, and Gavi (a vaccine alliance founded by the Gates Foundation) claims to advocate in favor of ""ethical, privacy-protecting approaches to digital ID,"" with the mission of providing digital IDs for people worldwide by 2030.  The digital IDs would be tied to biometric data, demographic information, medical records, education data, financial data and more.  This year, Bill Gates announced $200 million more funding for digital ID projects globally.  Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these organizations advocated for using health and immunization records as a way to scale up digital IDs, an idea they also promoted at the World Economic Forum in Davos.  Governments have already begun to use people’s health data to manipulate their behavior. In January, Quebec announced that it planned to place a significant ""health tax"" on unvaccinated people. During the pandemic, ""vaccine passports"" were widely required for access to public spaces.  Last month, leaders of the Group of 20 (G-20) issued a joint declaration promoting a global standard on proof of vaccination for international travel and calling for the establishment of ""global digital health networks"" that build on existing digital COVID-19 vaccine passport schemes.  Vaccine passports, digital identities, social credit systems, and central bank digital currencies together can form a system of digital control, computer scientist Aman Jabbi explained in a recent interview with ZeeMedia. Such a system depends on data collected through surveillance cameras, smart devices, and the increasing use of biometric data for everyday transactions.  According to Brand:  ""This is why it is all the more concerning that we are seeing again, through the process of commerce and convenience, new technology introduced that will give centralized Big Tech resources — which as you know are deeply interpolated with political and government agencies — the ability to garner more of your data.""  Warning about the conclusions of the study, he continued:  ""So in a sense, you could see how a story saying that people who didn’t get vaccinated are causing car crashes while there are new investigations into the efficacy of those vaccines that were, as I recall, quite aggressively pushed means that we oughtn’t be marching open-hearted with our trousers down into the arms of data capture organizations even if they are saying that they are ultimately going to offer us other services.  ""There’s enough evidence to suggest that these Big Tech platforms and data-capture giants operate in coordination with the government to push an agenda that is not beneficial to anybody but themselves."""
Propaganda,"A pair of cardiologists are warning people to stop getting mRNA coronavirus vaccines because the more doses a person takes, the more likely they could suffer heart damage.  The Epoch Times reported that Dr. Aseem Malhotra and Dr. Peter McCullough say the vaccines have done more harm than good and that a large percentage of people who have taken the jabs have suffered enduring health problems, in particular with their hearts. As such, the administration of the vaccines has to be halted, and the sooner, the better.  They even cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) V-Safe data, which found that one-quarter of those who took an mRNA vaccine were incapacitated the next day, with around 8 percent seeking attention in an emergency room or having to be hospitalized.  ""This is the most toxic vaccine by the CDC data that we’ve ever seen in clinical medicine,"" McCullough said during a recent interview with Malhotra for EpochTV’s ""American Thought Leaders"" program.  McCullough is one of the most published cardiologists in the country, as well as being the chief scientific officer of The Wellness Company. He believes the 8 percent who went to the hospital most likely had contracted COVID-19 before they got their vaccine.  ""I think all cardiovascular conditions have got worse because of the vaccine, and anything and everything that can go wrong with the heart has gone wrong with the heart as a result of this mRNA vaccine,"" added Malhotra, who has written a great deal about how to reverse heart disease by changing lifestyles.  ""The part of the virus that causes the heart damage is called the spike protein,"" said McCullough.  The Epoch Times added:  Myocarditis is one of the more common injuries caused when the patient gets a high dose of spike protein with the shot, the doctors said, so the claim by the mainstream medical establishment that the risk of myocarditis is greater without the vaccine is false.  In addition, there is no evidence to support the claim by the drug industry that mild infection with COVID-19 or the omicron variant is causing sudden death, said Malhotra.  ""There is a risk for traditional cardiovascular events because of this big inflammatory incident the body gets with COVID respiratory illness, but there is a small negligible risk of myocarditis with COVID, the respiratory infection, probably because the body doesn’t get this massive exposure to the spike protein, as it does with the vaccines,"" said McCullough.  ""I think people shouldn’t be distracted by this false narrative that mild COVID may be causing a massive surge in cardiac arrests,"" Malhotra said, adding that he believes there would have been far less harm to the public if the mRNA vaccines had not been used.  ""These vaccines have had a hugely negative impact on society, on health, and of course, everything that’s gone on with it has eroded trust, as well, in medicine,"" he said. ""What was most criminal is telling people who had natural immunity to take the vaccine.""  McCullough also indicated that the way the vaccine trials were conducted was also problematic and incorrect. He noted that when the big pharma companies and the Food and Drug Administration were registering people for the trials, they rejected anyone who had contracted the virus and women who were pregnant or who could become pregnant.  ""When we have exclusion criteria in clinical trials, the exclusions must be justified, and the rationale to justify the exclusion was, they did not have an opportunity for benefit and they had an opportunity for harm,"" he said.  The doctors also said that the pandemic is over, so there is no reason to continue any emergency measures because of it.  ""We’re dealing with a cold"" now, said Malhotra. ""People need to be told the truth. We need to stop scaring people."""
Propaganda,"Outgoing White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has admitted that his daughter previously worked as a software engineer at Twitter and that he spoke with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg multiple times during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  In a full sworn statement of Fauci on the ongoing case regarding social media censorship, it was revealed that Fauci’s daughter worked for Twitter at the start of the pandemic. He, however, said in the deposition released by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt on Monday, Dec. 5, that they never discussed content posted to social media as a response to a question thrown by Attorney D. John Sauer. (Related: Twitter slaps down Project Veritas moments after exposing major Fauci ""gain of function"" research lie with ban from platform.)  ""Did you ever discuss with her the origins of the virus or concerns about the origins of the virus?"" Sauer asked.  ""No, she has no interest in that,"" Fauci answered and added that she stopped working for the platform ""over a year ago.""  The retiring National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director insisted that he is not interested in any social media platforms and does not have personal accounts on Twitter or Facebook.  ""I don’t do any of that, so I’m not familiar with that. I’ve never gotten involved in any of that,"" he claimed. However, when asked by Sauer if he knew anyone that worked for social media companies at the time, he replied: ""Well, I’ve had communications with Mark Zuckerberg in the past who was – I’ve done, I believe, three outward FaceTime discussions encouraging people to get vaccinated.""  He replied ""I don’t recall"" 174 times throughout the deposition, which is part of a social media censorship lawsuit filed by Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry earlier this year.  The lawsuit alleged that key figures in the Biden administration, including President Joe Biden himself, ""have colluded with and/or coerced social media companies to suppress disfavored speakers, viewpoints and content on social media platforms by labeling the content ‘dis-information,’ ‘misinformation’ and ‘mal-information.'""  When activist and radio talk show host Charlie Kirk tweeted the news about Fauci’s daughter previously working at Twitter, the platform’s new CEO Elon Musk responded with two words: ""Small world.""  Musk suspends Twitter’s COVID-19 misinformation policy As of November 23, Twitter no longer enforces the COVID-19 misinformation policy according to its online rules. The next day, users of the social media platform started testing the new boundaries and celebrating the platform’s hands-off approach.  ""This policy was used to silence people across the world who questioned the media narrative surrounding the virus and treatment options,"" physician Dr. Simone Gold said. ""A win for free speech and medical freedom.""  As expected, the so-called ""experts"" in public health and other fields didn’t like this development, saying that the changes in Twitter policies can have serious consequences.  ""Bad news,"" epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding tweeted. He urged people not to flee Twitter, but to keep up the fight against bad information about the virus. ""Stay folks – do NOT cede the town square to them!""  Paul Russo, a social media researcher and dean of the Katz School of Science and Health at Yeshiva University in New York, also criticized Musk’s move.  ""It is 100 percent the responsibility of the platform to protect its users from harmful content,"" Russo said. ""This is absolutely unacceptable."""
Propaganda,"As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread throughout the United States, it is exploding in New York City. Research shows thousands of infected persons from New York spread coronavirus through much of the country before the city began implementing its lockdown protocols. The unrestricted travel helped fuel outbreaks in Louisiana, Texas, Arizona and even in West Coast states.  The data has been drawn from geneticists tracking signature mutations of the virus, the travel histories of people with COVID-19 and outbreak models made by infectious disease experts.  ""We now have enough data to feel pretty confident that New York was the primary gateway for the rest of the country,"" said epidemiologist Nathan Grubaugh of the Yale School of Public Health.  NYC joins other urban hot spots around the world, such as Wuhan in China, Milan in Italy and Qom in Iran, which all have become vectors for coronavirus.   New York City becomes ""Grand Central Station"" of coronavirus On March 14, NYC closed down all of the city’s public libraries; this was followed by the city’s schools on March 15; and on March 17, theaters, nightclubs and concert venues were also shut down. The following week, on March 22, Gov. Andrew Cuomo put the whole state on lockdown.  Despite the lockdown, the coronavirus still continued to spread throughout the U.S. because by this time, NYC had already turned into the ""Grand Central Station"" of coronavirus, according to David Engelthaler, head of infectious disease at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Arizona.  What this means is that the city acted late to prevent the domestic spread of the coronavirus. However, even if they had locked down the city – and the state – early enough, the virus probably would have continued to spread. One of America’s early outbreaks came from Seattle. This spread the coronavirus throughout Washington state and across 14 other states, including Connecticut and Maryland in the Eastern Seaboard.  But the spread of the Seattle outbreak was nothing compared to the spread of NYC. By the end of February, thousands of infected people had passed through the city and, during crucial weeks in March when the city would have been able to take decisive action to quell the spread of the virus, the city’s political leaders waited too long before taking aggressive action. This, despite the fact that NYC already had tens of thousands of cases by the time Cuomo shut down the whole state.   Genetic signatures of coronavirus can be traced back to New York City Geneticists analyzed and shared over 2,000 coronavirus samples from infected people all over the country.  As the virus spread throughout the U.S., it replicates and picks up different mutations which, while they don’t change the behavior of the virus, can help researchers pinpoint the virus’ origins.  Many of the samples taken from COVID-19 patients in Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Louisiana, Idaho and many other states carried with them distinct mutations that the geneticists traced back to New York. Grubaugh estimated that infections that spread from NYC accounted for around 60 to 65 percent of the virus samples they sequenced. However, other scientists want to take more samples before calculating precise figures.  Despite that, Grubaugh and the other researchers agreed that travelers from New York has played a prominent role in the spread of the coronavirus across the United States. They believe the national spread may have begun in early March, around two weeks before the state’s lockdown orders were issued. This is supported by The New York Times, who analyzed cellphone and travel data and found that the severity of the outbreak in certain areas depended on how many people in that location had been to New York in the past two weeks.  The analysis also found that a majority of the viruses tied to New York had a distinct genetic signature that they were able to link to outbreaks in Europe, suggesting that European visitors to the city helped spread the virus. This contrasts with the Seattle outbreak, which had genetic signatures linking directly traceable to China. (Related: New York City becomes the new Wuhan: Big Apple now the new US epicenter of global coronavirus pandemic.)  NYC and Seattle aren’t the only sources of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Other large urban areas have also contributed to the spread, and the coronavirus is showing a more diverse genetic mix, especially in areas in the Midwest and in parts of the South.  Furthermore, even as domestic travel was spreading coronavirus throughout the country, international travelers were also bringing the virus in, which is why some scientists believe it may be too early to put a lot of the blame on NYC alone. It is still possible, they argue, that some of the virus samples the geneticists attributed to NYC may have instead come from Europe, especially through direct flights or lay-overs in NYC.  For this reason, some scientists want to continue their research and gather more samples to try and figure out how the coronavirus spread so rapidly throughout the U.S. – and possibly figure out a way to better halt it dead in its tracks."
Propaganda,"Lockdown orders throughout the country to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) are nearing their end, but it’s too early to rejoice. Experts even suggest that it would be wise to order second lockdowns to ensure that they are not lifted prematurely.  While the future is uncertain, here are some tips for preppers who want to get ready before the next coronavirus lockdowns are enforced.  Are extended lockdowns necessary? Note that the coronavirus won’t just disappear after you observe lockdown orders. Even after the lockdown period is over, there’s still the chance that you can get infected if you spend time outdoors without taking precautions.  According to experts, it is likely that the country will suffer a ""second wave"" of coronavirus infections. Some suggest it might occur soon after lockdown ends, but others say that there could be a seasonal link and that it will happen sometime in the Fall.  There are rumors from China about a possible second wave of coronavirus, but reliable reports from the country have been hard to come by since the pandemic began.  Researchers have yet to determine if recovering from coronavirus grants former patients immunity to the disease. Conflicting data notes that it’s impossible to develop immunity, while other reports say antibodies in the plasma of recovered patients can benefit those who are currently infected.  Signs hint at an incoming second wave of infections. As a prepper, it is your responsibility to prepare for the worst and to learn from your experiences during the first lockdowns put in place to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.  Things you need to do differently Regardless of when the second surge of coronavirus infections happen, you need to be prepared for the second round of lockdowns.  Learn from your previous mistakes and how you handled scenarios such as:  Running out of food during the lockdown. Not having essential non-food supplies in your stockpile. Not having access to items you’ll need to repair appliances in your homestead. Not having toys or books to entertain kids or other family members. Review the preps you were satisfied with, and do them again to get ready for a second lockdown. (Related: A prepper’s guide to surviving a coronavirus lockdown.)  Having enough cash in your emergency funds. Being able to cook delicious and nutritious meals using your food supplies. Not needing to leave the house for emergency supply runs. Review your two lists, then make a third list of the things you need to buy or need to do before the second lockdown.  Replenish your supply of ingredients for favorite meals. Buy more items that you ran out of first. Restock your pantry so you have what you need for another long-term lockdown. Purchase tools and repair materials for your gear. Buy things that will keep your family entertained. Finalize an inventory of supplies so you can replenish your stockpile. Review your budget You may be one of the millions of Americans who experienced dramatic changes in their incomes over the last few months.  If you’re barely able to cover your bills, you may have trouble stocking up for another lockdown. If this is one of your concerns, review your budget. Take advantage of whatever the government via financial assistance.  Don’t waste money on things you don’t need, and see if you can cut any fixed expenses.  Items to buy for the next lockdown Here are some supplies that you might need more of. Once you have reviewed your budget, set aside some money, and start stocking up before things get any worse.  Baking powder Baking soda Bleach Canned fruits – Opt for canned fruits with no added sugar. The vitamin C levels will vary from 45 percent (peaches) to 90 percent (grapefruit) of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) per serving, depending on the type of canned fruit you buy. Canned fish – Fish is rich in both protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Canned fish like anchovies, salmon, sardines and tuna can be used in sandwiches for lunch and main dishes. If the nearest store is offering promotions or discounts, buy dozens of cans that have a long shelf life. Canned vegetables – Vegetables like carrots, corn, green beans and peas are full of fiber and vitamin C. Disinfectant cleaners Dried fruit – Dried fruit is another source of essential nutrients. Use dried fruit as toppings for cereal, oatmeal and yogurt. Alternatively, you can bake with dried fruit for a much-needed sweet treat during the lockdown. Dry foods (e.g., pasta and rice) Flour Hand sanitizer Lysol wipes Meat Paper plates Paper towels Toilet paper Vitamin C supplements If your area doesn’t enforce a second lockdown, you can still use these items in your stockpile for the next long-term SHTF scenario.  Start replenishing your supplies immediately. Don’t buy these things all at once so you don’t use up too much of your funds. If your tools and appliances need some repairs, get them taken care of before the next lockdown takes effect.  Prepare your family before SHTF again Make sure your family members are better prepared for another lockdown. Note how your family behaved during the first lockdown, and see if any of them had trouble dealing with the changes, such as not being allowed to come and go as they please.  If a loved one was depressed, anxious, or feeling lonely during the initial lockdown, talk to them in private and let them know that their feelings are valid, particularly during times of dramatic change.  Teach them that being prepared for a second lockdown is one way of helping themselves move past these feelings and accomplish the things that must be done for the survival of your whole family.  Monitor the news and get your family used to the possibility of another lockdown. You don’t need to scare them, but make it known that they should be ready for whatever happens in the next few weeks."
Propaganda,"As many parts of the country are starting to reopen their economies, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has argued that officials need to be upfront about the human cost of these reopenings. The governor said that the debate on when to reopen outbreak-hit economies ultimately boils down to the value placed on people’s lives.  ""How much is a human life worth?"" Cuomo asked during his daily news briefing. ""That’s the real discussion that no one is admitting openly or freely. But we should.""  Factoring in the human cost of reopening The governor of the state hit hardest by the coronavirus (COVID-19) made the argument in the face of mounting political pressure to relax epidemic-fighting restrictions. For New York, Cuomo adopted a slower approach that will allow parts of the state to phase in economic activity later this month if they’re able to meet and maintain a series of benchmarks.  ""The faster we reopen, the lower the economic cost — but the higher the human cost, because the more lives lost,"" the governor said. ""That, my friends, is the decision we are really making.""  According to Cuomo, his plan avoids the trade-off between economic and human costs, because it will be controlled by officials constantly monitoring fatalities and hospitalizations. (Related: Talking about reopening the economy, Texas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick says ""There are more important things than living."")  Cuomo also reported that the state had 230 deaths Tuesday. This number is slightly up from the previous day, but far lower than the daily peak of 799 on April 8. The state has had more than 19,000 deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic began. The state total, however, does not include more than 5,300 New York City deaths that were blamed on the virus but were not verified in lab tests.  New York’s hospitalization rates also continued to drop, with only 659 new admissions reported Monday — the lowest number since March. Overall, the state has seen 9,600 patients hospitalized from the virus.  New York will reopen in phases On Monday, Gov. Cuomo presented a soft blueprint for how New York’s economy might begin to restart, laying down a set of criteria that will determine which regions allow what sectors to open.  ""This is not a sustainable situation,"" Cuomo said of the shutdown, now in its seventh week. ""Close down everything, close down the economy, lock yourself in the home. You can do it for a short period of time, but you can’t do it forever.""  According to Cuomo, the state will rely heavily on progress in key areas — declines in positive virus cases and deaths, and increases in testing, contact tracing and hospital capacity — under a complex formula that will determine when parts of the state would be eligible to reopen.  Once the requirements are met, the first phase of the plan would allow for manufacturing, construction and some retail stores to reopen for curbside pickup, after May 15. This is similar to what California is doing.  After two weeks, the effects of the first phase would be evaluated. If the indicators are still positive, the second phase would allow professional services, as well as more retailers and real estate firms to reopen, perhaps as soon as the end of May.  The third phase would allow restaurants, bars and hotels to reopen. This would be followed by a fourth and final phase that would include cinemas and theaters, including Broadway.  ""It’s just common sense,"" said Broadway League president Charlotte St. Martin of the plan which will see her industry open last. ""We hate it, but we get it.""  In addition to theaters, schools, which have been canceled statewide for the rest of the academic year, will also be covered in the final phase of reopenings."
Propaganda,"A Colorado medic who had volunteered to help fight the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City passed away on April 30. Paul Cary had come all the way from Denver to help out in the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. before succumbing to the disease himself.  ""It was so busy when we first got here… We had a few long days,"" stated fellow paramedic and friend, Royce Davis. Both Davis and Cary were stationed in the Bronx where they were helping with facility transfers with on-demand ambulance service Ambulnz. Davis recalls how they would constantly look out for each other amid the city’s battle with the coronavirus.  ""We would see each other every day, check up on each other, make sure we were rested, and doing good,"" Davis recalled.  Cary volunteered to help even though he was retired Cary, a retired firefighter who worked for three decades with Aurora Fire Rescue, arrived in New York City in late March, days before authorities issued an emergency alert ""seeking licensed health care workers.""  For three weeks, Cary drove an ambulance transporting COVID-19 patients to hospitals and helped dispatch 911 calls due to the high volume. He started feeling sick shortly after signing up for a second 30-day deployment in New York. He was admitted to the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx where he eventually succumbed to the disease.  Cary had been employed by Ambulnz, which deployed 72 employees from across the country, including California, Tennessee and Colorado, to help in New York.  ""Paul’s career is best defined by his kindness and service to others during his time as a paramedic at Ambulnz, and before that as a firefighter/paramedic of more than 30 years with the Aurora, Colorado Fire Department,"" read an official statement from the company.  On May 1, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that New York City was grieving for Cary and that the city would erect a memorial to him.  ""We have lost someone who came to our aid, to our defense,"" the mayor said. ""And there’s something particularly painful when someone does the right thing — a fellow American comes from across the country to try to help the people of New York City, and while working to save lives here, gives his own life.""  ""Thank you to Paul’s family,"" de Blasio added. ""We will remember him and memorialize him. It’s so important to remember this great example of heroism.""  On May 3, the fallen paramedic’s body was escorted by an honor guard and procession — with more than 50 ambulances and first responders — to Newark Liberty International Airport. His remains were then flown to Denver, where a second ceremony took place.  ""He risked his own health and safety to protect others and left this world a better place,"" Cary’s family said in a statement. ""We are at peace knowing that Paul did what he loved and what he believed in, right up until the very end.""  Cary was among the thousands of first responders who traveled to New York to help the city during one of its darkest hours. According to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office, more than 94,000 active and retired healthcare workers have signed up online to help in New York City, including more than 27,000 from outside the state. City officials have stated that the additional help from these workers has been invaluable.  His passing comes as infection rates in New York City and the surrounding areas have slowly declined, even as cases outside the state continue to rise.

Propaganda,"The African nation of Tanzania recently sent samples to the WHO for coronavirus testing. Among those items that tested positive for the coronavirus were samples from a goat, a papaya and a pheasant, all at once exposing the total science fraud behind coronavirus testing.  As we’ve warned for over a month, most coronavirus tests produce huge numbers of false positives. The testing kits are largely made in China, and either through gross incompetence or malicious intent, China-made lab tests are notorious for being so inaccurate that they’re practically useless.  Notably, the infamous ""Stanford Study"" which was seized upon by the conservative media to claim that the coronavirus had already infected a large percentage of the population and therefore wasn’t very deadly also relied in China-made antibody tests that produced huge numbers of false positives. Those who touted the findings of the Stanford Study were actually getting hoodwinked by China, it turns out. And similar antibody tests have been run in New York, allowing Cuomo to spread total disinformation to the public, claiming somewhere around 14% of all New Yorkers have already been infected with the virus.  We now have enough knowledge of the ""false positives"" testing fiasco to be able to say, with confidence, that the official coronavirus infection numbers are wildly over-stated. Nowhere near that number of people have actually been infected.  And that means the coronavirus is far more deadly than what people are being led to believe.  Why the coronavirus actually kills about 10% of those who become symptomatic In the United States, the official numbers currently show that 1.35 million people are confirmed as infected, while 80,351 people have so far died from the virus. If you take these numbers at face value, that would put the current Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for the coronavirus at 5.9%.  The infection numbers, though, are wildly over-inflated due to faulty testing kits that produce false positives. If we adjust the infection numbers down to a more realistic level, the CFR jumps significantly higher. And yes, there are likely some people dying from other things who have been incorrectly counted as COVID-19 deaths, but the Financial Times analysis of excess mortalities from all causes ends that argument by documenting a huge surge in recent deaths from any cause, regardless of what’s stated on death certificates.  If anything, the number of coronavirus deaths is being under-stated by perhaps 50% or so, while the number of coronavirus infections is being over-stated by a wide margin.  And we actually have a way to take a good guess at the degree by which those infection numbers are over-inflated.  We already know that many of these kits produce somewhere around 10 false positives per 100 people tested, or a 10% false positive rate (many kits are far worse). We can also intelligently estimate that right now somewhere around 2% of the US population has actually been infected. This is a rough estimate, but as you’ll see below, whether this is 1% or 4% doesn’t change the conclusions by much.  Now, if you test 100 people for the coronavirus, and 2 out of those 100 actually have the coronavirus, but the test kits you’re using have a false positive rate of 10 out of 100, then you will get, essentially 12 positives out of 100.  Notably, 10 of those positives are false, and 2 are real. This means the false positives are 500% higher than the real positives. And if you rely on those findings, you would incorrectly think that 500% more people have been infected than actually have.  This is precisely what the Stanford Study did. They ran tests that produced false positives, then they extrapolated that false finding to the entire population of California. From that, they incorrectly concluded that a huge percentage of California had already been infected, and therefore the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of the coronavirus was very, very small. As we show in this Natural News article, Stanford researchers likely produced 13 false positives for every 1 real positive.  That entire conclusion falls apart when you realize the testing kits they used were made in China. In fact, those particular kits were so unreliable that Stanford researchers tried to hide the origins of the kits in their paper, but internet sleuths found out the kits were actually made by Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, a company that ranked last place in testing kit accuracy. As ExtremeTech.com explained:  At the time Stanford did the study, there weren’t any FDA-approved COVID-19 antibody tests for clinical use. But for research purposes, the team purchased tests from Premier Biotech in Minnesota. Premier has started marketing a COVID-19 antibody test, but it doesn’t create it. The test listed on the company’s website, and that it appears Stanford used, is from Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, an established Chinese lab test vendor.  It also turned out that the Wall Street Journal writer who touted the stunning findings of the paper was one of the paper co-authors who failed to identify his obvious conflict of interest. So the entire study — and the subsequent WSJ editorial coverage of it — was a rigged scam, 100% science fraud parading around as breaking news to try to deceive America into thinking the coronavirus was no real danger at all. It was a propaganda con job, and sadly, most of the pro-Trump independent media fell for it and repeated the bad conclusions, misinforming their own audiences and causing many people to believe the virus was ""no more dangerous than the flu.""  Peak Prosperity also explained this in a detailed video, which I covered in this important podcast:    If you really crunch the numbers on this, it turns out the coronavirus is 56 to 100 times more deadly than the regular flu. But to realize that, you have to weed through the deliberate disinformation being pushed by those who are trying to downplay the severity of the virus for political reasons. (A foolish ploy that will catastrophically backfire when the second wave of infections becomes impossible to deny.)  Bad tests and false positives: The upshot of what it really means So what does all this really mean in a practical sense? Here are the bullet points of the rational conclusions:  The infection numbers are wildly over-stated due to false positives from bogus testing kits. This means the infection fatality rates are under-stated, since far fewer people have been infected than we were led to believe. It also means that herd immunity is far off, since the actual percentage of people who have been infected is much smaller than what researchers have been reporting. In truth, the real number of infections may be just 1/10th what researchers have estimated (or even lower). Any attempt to leap across the chasm and try to rapidly achieve herd immunity in the USA will result in disaster (and mass death). This also means that reopening economies without taking proper precautions — such as wearing masks, which can end the pandemic if just 80% of the people participate — will lead to a catastrophic second round of infections and deaths. Finally, and perhaps most worryingly, this means that people are being told they’ve already been infected and are therefore immune and can go back to work. When, in reality, most of those people have never been infected at all. This will result in many people having a false sense of security, which would likely lead many of these people to avoid taking adequate precautions such as wearing masks. In effect, the result of bad tests producing false positives is mass confusion and the gross mis-allocation of resources to fight the pandemic. If that sounds like the precise scenario that communist China would be trying to unleash across America as part of a biological warfare playbook, you’re exactly right.  That’s why we believe the false positive test kits are deliberately manufactured to be faulty as a way for China to magnify the spread of the coronavirus pandemic outside of China as part of its multiple waves of biological warfare against the West.  Almost certainly, China reserved the accurate kits for itself while exporting known ""bad"" kits to nations like the United States, all while pressuring the WHO to claim there was no pandemic at all."
Propaganda,"You’ve probably heard the bizarre claim that hospitals are faking all the covid-19 deaths because they’re being rewarded with extra compensation from Medicare. No one is really dying from coronavirus, the deniers claim, and all the official death figures are simply counting people who would have died anyway, they say.  But there are two glaring problems with that theory. The first and most obvious is that hospitals in lockdown zones (like New York City) have been steadily reporting substantial decreases in the number of covid-19 deaths since about April 10th (see the chart below). If hospitals were faking deaths to collect more money, wouldn’t they engineer the death numbers to go higher rather than lower?  In other words, do the pandemic denialists really want us to believe that hospitals hate money and want less of it?  After 7 weeks of aggressive lockdowns that prevented the person-to-person spread of the coronavirus, New York announced today that hospitalizations have fallen to mid-March levels for the first time since the lockdowns began. On Saturday, 521 people were hospitalized with coronavirus infections and 207 died. These are the best numbers New York has seen in nearly two months. At the peak of the deaths, New York was seeing nearly 1,000 people die each day, and hospitals were stretched way beyond normal capacity.  It turns out that the lockdowns just narrowly averted a colossal disaster of mass death in New York. Had Gov. Cuomo waited even one more week to initiate those lockdowns, the number of dead would have reached nearly 4,000 per day by around April 17th. That’s because the virus was doubling the number of infected about every 3.5 days, which means a one week delay would have quadrupled the number of people infected. And by the end of April, New York would have been seeing around 16,000 deaths per day.  As the record shows, the deaths in New York peaked at around April 10th, which is roughly a 3-4 week lag time after the lockdowns were initiated. There’s a critical lesson in this that many states have already learned: Even after you initiate the lockdowns, hospitalizations and deaths will continue to surge for another 3-4 weeks. After that, the numbers begin to fall off for the simple reason that fewer people are getting infected due to the social distancing lockdown measures.    Source: Covid19.healthdata.org  Are pandemic denialists now going to tell us that New York hospitals are FAKING the drop in deaths? Pandemic denialists are at a loss to explain the drop in hospitalizations since April 10th. Many insist the coronavirus was no big deal from the start, claiming lockdowns weren’t necessary and don’t even work. But if you ask them to offer an explanation of why New York experienced a +299% increase in excess mortalities from any cause, and why nearly 1,000 people were dying every day during the peak of the coronavirus there, and why those deaths have significantly dropped after 7 weeks of lockdowns, they have no explanation that fits with observed reality.  They essentially claim that the lockdowns have nothing to do with the decline in coronavirus deaths. They quite literally believe that the sharp rise in deaths shown above was some sort of random, spontaneous event without cause. Similarly, they believe the decline in deaths also took place without cause. To people who don’t understand exponential math, many phenomena in the world around them appear to be random when, in reality, they all have initiating causes.  Don’t forget that these people claim hospitals are faking all the deaths because they get paid more for recording ""covid-19"" deaths. But if that’s true, then why would hospitals engineer sharp declines in those numbers rather than increasing them to collect more money?  Are these same denialists now going to tell us that hospitals are faking the declines for some reason? But what would be the financial incentive to fake declines in deaths? Or perhaps they’ll tell us that the hospitals have run out of fake deaths to fake…  Anyone can have a theory about anything. Theories are a dime a dozen. What matters isn’t the existence of a theory but rather how well the theory matches observed reality.  That’s why Flat Earth is a theory, but it fails to explain the movement of the sun, moon and stars, as well as the effects of gravity. Similarly, pandemic denialism is also a theory, but it fails to explain the sudden surge and then decline in coronavirus deaths that has now been observed all across the world, in over 100 countries. As documented by the Financial Times:  Excess mortalities in New York City:    Excess mortalities in Italy:    Excess mortalities in Spain:    Nearly a dozen other countries:    Would pandemic denialists now claim that hospitals in Italy and Spain are also being financially incentivized by Medicare to falsely claim covid-19 deaths? Because that would be really be a tall tale.  The spread of a highly contagious pandemic explains all the observed hospitalizations and deaths Clearly, something has been killing people in a huge surge of mortalities, all around the world, all at nearly the same time, racking up death numbers that skyrocket far above typical mortalities.  The pandemic denialists want you to believe that a global conspiracy of doctors, nurses, coroners and hospitals is faking covid-19 deaths worldwide, all in concert, all on command, and that now they are all faking declines in deaths, too.  Occam’s Razor tells is the simpler explanation is probably more likely to be true: The deaths are being caused by a transmissible infection that spread around the world. The declines in deaths are being observed because most of the world initiated aggressive lockdowns to prevent a catastrophic outcome, and this caused the daily deaths to fall over time.  That’s why the deaths are falling: Because the lockdowns were a necessary survival mechanism, and had they not been put in place, the USA, all by itself, would already be seeing something like 25,000 deaths per day (or even higher). By July, we would have seen millions of deaths.  Of course, as we’ve repeatedly pointed out here, we can now lift the lockdowns if people would just wear masks and take vitamin D. We already know that if 80% of the population wears a mask, the virus spread grinds to a halt within just a few weeks. We also know that taking zinc, selenium and vitamin D offer substantial immune system protections that may further defend public health. Yet instead of people embracing these simple solutions to restore our freedoms and economic activities, we now face ""anti-maskers"" who refuse to wear masks, claiming the masks aren’t necessary because, as you might expect, they also claim all the deaths were faked in the first place.  At that point, you have to realize you’re dealing with a kind of shared delusion… a mass mental illness that has ravaged the minds of the misinformed (who listened to Rush Limbaugh and Fox News). If you can’t reason with these people and get at least 4 out of 5 to wear masks in public, the only available option is to re-initiate the lockdowns once the virus begins to spread again.  And that’s probably what’s coming, given that America is now a land of shared delusions and widespread scientific illiteracy. Desperate to deny reality by any means necessary, far too many people have decided the virus faded away all on its own, for no apparent reason, and that it will simply vanish without cause, never to haunt us again.  Stupid-19 has struck again.  America is dominated by superstition, not by intellect America has become more of a land of superstition than a nation of intellect. When the masses have no idea why things happen — or why observed phenomena stop happening — then all events are a sudden surprise. (Which is exactly why the masses get wiped out in every stock market reset that’s actually a mass transfer of wealth from the financially ignorant to the financially prepared.)  It’s a true statement that the world is divided into two types of people: Those who can grasp exponential phenomena (maybe 1 in 1,000 people) and those who cannot (999 in 1,000).  All the exponential events that take place in the world around them — positive feedback loop stock market crashes, the acceleration of gravity, the spread of pandemics and the physics of nuclear fission in a nuclear bomb — are great mysterious to the 999 out of 1,000. The world is a blur of inexplicable events to these people, and they are always behind the curve when it comes to getting caught in a dollar collapse, or a stock market crash, or a pandemic. These people see events as spontaneous and random, when in reality, all events have an initiating cause. Identifying that cause, however, is simply beyond the mental comprehension of these people, so they only see the world as a series of random events usually attributed to luck.  There’s no such thing as luck. There is only cause and effect. Every physical event has a cause, even if those causes are beyond the mental cognition of the masses. The difficulty in all this is that emergent properties of complex systems are extremely difficult to model and predict. Complex systems include things like human physiology, global weather, or the stock market. In these complex systems, very tiny changes affecting inputs can have wildly magnified impacts on outcomes, often due to things like self-reinforcing feedback loops.  Ever wonder why supercomputers can’t accurately forecast the weather just 30 days out? Because there are too many ""butterfly effect"" interactions where very tiny changes in initial conditions produce extremely hard-to-predict final outcomes.  Exponential phenomena are often part of these complex systems, and such phenomena are found throughout nature, in things like the growth of bacteria or the spread of a virus. Because the human mind isn’t wired to accurately assess exponential phenomena — we tend to think in linear terms — almost no one can accurately estimate future outcomes that depend on exponential factors without resorting to mathematical modeling.  Importantly, when the cognitive demands to understand natural phenomena become too cognitively strenuous, people turn to superstition in a last-ditch attempt to explain the workings of the world around them. Playing the lottery might make them rich, they tell themselves, or getting caught in a global financial reset was just a matter of ""bad luck.""  The coronavirus is faked, the Earth is flat, carbon dioxide is a pollutant and ""climate change"" is real. These are all delusional, cult-like beliefs being paraded around as facts when, in truth, they are superstitions that only achieve a seeming consensus because so many people buy into their false claims.  That’s because humanity is a suicide cult, as you’ve heard me say numerous times. The ""suicide"" part comes from the self-destructive nature of human expansion and ecological destruction that eventually turns back on the destroyers. The ""cult"" part comes from the tendency for intellectually suppressed individuals to surrender their beliefs to the consensus of their chosen cult rather than figure things out for themselves. There isn’t one person in a thousand living in America today who can think for themselves, against the cult of the consensus. And this is more obvious than ever, watching the disappointing reaction to the coronavirus pandemic.  Watching conservatives latch on to the coronavirus ""hoax"" conspiracy is just as pathetic and bizarre as watching progressives celebrate post-birth abortions as some twisted form of ""women’s reproductive health care.""  The question for you is: Are you among the ONE, or the one thousand? The ONE is willing to stand for truth against a thousand-strong delusional mob. But 999 will go with the mob because they want to be accepted rather than right. Obedience and acceptance, you see. That’s how nearly all human beings are wired, and that’s why nearly all humans work actually born to be enslaved. They’re wired for it. They have no cognitive capacity to escape the mental prison that has been constructed for them by all the disinfo strewn about by the fake news media sources, which spans all political parties and all industries.  It’s easy for people to chant ""freedom"" at a public protest as long as they’re followed orders and going along with the mob. But that isn’t freedom; it’s obedience and conformity.  What’s far more difficult and rare, it seems, is for someone to demand reason."
Propaganda,"Coronavirus test kits in Tanzania have raised suspicions about their accuracy. President John Magufuli expressed during an event that he found them so unreliable due to the fact that certain animals and even a fruit have tested positive for COVID-19.  He further stated that the test kits were imported from overseas, but refused to specify where.  In order to evaluate the quality of the COVID-19 test kits, security forces in Tanzania obtained non-human samples from a goat, a papaya, a quail and even a sheep. The samples were assigned human names and then shipped off to a laboratory to be tested. Lab technicians who worked on the non-human samples weren’t informed about their true origins.  The test results showed that the goat, quail and papaya were found positive for COVID-19, which may have serious implications. According to Magufuli, this means some people could have received positive coronavirus test results despite not actually being infected.  This puts into question the country’s actual number of coronavirus cases. As of press time, the country has 509 reported cases of COVID-19, including 21 deaths. However, the actual number of cases could be higher because Tanzania goes days without providing updates.  A ""dirty game"" is going on in Tanzania’s coronavirus testing lab Magufuli, who initially downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, suspended the head of testing at Tanzania’s national health laboratory on May 4, one day after he revealed that the lab had tested the non-human samples, noting that there was a ""dirty game"" going on at the laboratory.  Hassan Abbas, chief government spokesman of Tanzania, said that the country has formed a team to conduct further investigations on the laboratory that did the tests. They will release the results of their investigations as soon as they are complete. (Related: African coronavirus cases SPIKE by 43 percent – WHO warns that continent could be the ""next epicenter"" of the pandemic.)  ""The equipment or people may be compromised and sometimes it can be sabotage,"" said Magufuli in a speech broadcast through the country’s state-run news outlet.  Magufuli further cast doubt on the foreign aid Tanzania was receiving, saying that it may not always be ""good for this nation"" and that they shouldn’t accept all of it.  Coronavirus test kits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma Africa’s testing capacity has expanded sharply since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the help of test kits procured from the WHO, the Jack Ma Foundation and other philanthropic organizations.  Jack Ma, Chinese billionaire and founder of the Alibaba Group, has donated thousands of test kits and protective gear to African nations. John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said that the Jack Ma Foundation had provided them with a lot of coronavirus test kits.  ""We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries and providing them with test kits,"" said Nkengasong. ""We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.""  Nkengasong told journalists that the Africa CDC affirmed that the Tanzanian coronavirus test kits are ""working very well."" The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed their confidence in the reliability of the test kits.  When questioned regarding the veracity of the coronavirus tests, Matshidiso Moeti, head of WHO Africa, said that the tests procured through their organization and through the donations made by the Jack Ma Foundation were not contaminated with coronavirus.  Magufuli turns to alternative sources of aid for coronavirus Losing any trust he had in the WHO and the Africa CDC, Magufuli has stated that he was sending a plane to Madagascar to collect an herbal mix that the country was touting as a cure for COVID-19. The herbal mix has not gone through internationally recognized scientific testing.  President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar has claimed that the herbal cure, known in the country as Covid-Organics, shows results within a week and that it has already cured two people so far.  Magufuli, in a speech, said that he was communicating with Madagascar regarding this COVID-19 cure. ""They have got a medicine,"" he said. ""The medicine will be brought in the country so that Tanzanians, too, can benefit."""
Propaganda,"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is keeping busy scrubbing all evidence from the website of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) that in any way implicates this controversial research institution in the unleashing of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) upon the world.  The latest thing to go is a series of photographs, all of which have been memory-holed, that show scientists at various WIV laboratories working on experiments without proper safety equipment. All references to visits by diplomats from the United States who later sounded the alarm about the school’s work involving bats have also been scrubbed.  This latest wave of censorship comes after President Donald Trump announced that intelligence he has been shown gives him a ""high degree of confidence"" that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic originated at the WIV. British Cabinet Ministers had likewise announced similar findings roughly a month prior to this, backing Trump’s later claims.  ""There are clearly questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus,"" stated a spokesman for Boris Johnson, a British Member of Parliament (MP).  One of the pictures that was removed from the WIV website depicted school staff members entering a cave to take swabs from bats carrying various coronaviruses. None of these staff members were wearing proper protective equipment in the photo, suggesting that they may have contracted the virus from these tainted bats.  The WIV also removed a reference on its website to Rick Switzer, a science and technology expert from the U.S. embassy in Beijing who visited the institute back in March 2018. Switzer had warned the State Department not long after his visit that he observed serious problems with the handling of bats and other related experiments.  ""During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they [the diplomats] noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,"" reads one of the cables that Switzer sent, warning of serious safety failures at the facility.  One refrigerator at WIV holdings 1,500 coronavirus strains had a ""broken seal"" Back in April, British media reported on a photo, also now scrubbed from the WIV website, that showed a broken seal on one of the lab’s refrigerators. This refrigerator was reportedly holding some 1,500 different coronavirus strains, any or all of which could have escaped because of this.  It remains unclear if this is the same photo that was shown to President Trump when he indicated at a recent press conference that he had, in fact, seen ""evidence"" to convince him that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) probably escaped from a WIV lab.  ""I can’t tell you that,"" Trump responded when pressed about the issue. ""I’m not allowed to tell you that.""  Meanwhile, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, representing various three-letter spy agencies in the federal government, issued its own statement indicating that ""the intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.""  Interestingly, the WIV itself admits that the work conducted there is risky. Alongside a website photo of staff members standing next to a communist flag, the institute has published a description of what goes on there indicating that ""highly pathogenic microorganisms"" are handled there, adding that ""once the test tube for storing viruses is opened in the laboratory, it is like opening the Pandora’s Box.""  ""These viruses come and go without a trace,"" a senior British security source added. ""There are various protective measures, but the experimental personnel still need to operate carefully to avoid danger due to operational errors.""  This same official added that the U.K., the U.S., and several other countries are all conducting investigations ""looking at all possibilities"" as to where the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) originated based on this evidence.  U.S. government funded coronavirus experiments on bats captured in Yunnan, located 1,000 miles away from Wuhan Part of this investigation will have to look into the many U.S. connections to the WIV, which, as we’ve reported, include multiple prestigious universities and research institutions, not to mention agencies within our own federal government.  One specific piece of information that deserves greater attention is the $3.7 million granted to the WIV by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct experiments on bat coronaviruses. Bats captured more than 1,000 miles away from Wuhan in an area of China known as Yunnan were taken back to WIV labs where they potentially mixed with other coronaviruses to become chimeras, and where one of these chimeras may have later escaped in the form of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).  This is still speculative, of course, but sequencing of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) genome has already determined that it did, in fact, come from bats living in the caves where WIV scientists had entered unprotected to collect samples. This alone is highly suggestive that the WIV is directly responsible for the release of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) into the general public.  President Trump has since ended all NIH funding to the WIV, even as the CCP insists that all of these suspicious links between the WIV and the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) are merely coincidental, calling them ""baseless conspiracy theories.""  But this can hardly be the case when video evidence has since surfaced showing China’s own government workers admitting on camera that the work being done with coronavirus bats is risky and has the great potential to unleash a pandemic.  ""We can easily get contact with the feces of bats which contaminate everything,"" says Tian Junhua, a researcher who works at the nearby Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, about what he has witnessed as far as bat samples being collected from area caves.  ""So it is highly risky here,"" he adds. ""I feel the fear. The fear of infections."""
Propaganda,"People suffering from vitamin D deficiency have a higher risk of contracting a fatal coronavirus infection, a new study has revealed.  A research team from Northwestern University conducted a statistical analysis of data gathered from hospitals and clinics across different countries such as China, France, Germany, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Vadim Backman, a professor of Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University‘s McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, who led the research team, said they were inspired to examine vitamin D levels after noticing unexplained differences in COVID-19 mortality rates from country to country.  According to Backman, while there were some who hypothesized that factors such as differences in healthcare quality, age distributions in population and testing rates might be responsible, their team remained unconvinced.  ""None of these factors appears to play a significant role,"" Backman, who is also the director of Northwestern’s Center for Physical Genomics and Engineering, said. He pointed out that Italy’s healthcare system is one of the best in the world, and that differences in mortality rates exist in the same age groups, as well as in countries that have similar testing rates.  It was when the researchers closely looked at data from patients hailing from countries with high COVID-19 mortality rates, namely Italy, Spain and the UK, that they observed a common denominator: they had generally lower levels of vitamin D compared to patients from countries that had significantly lower mortality rates.  In addition, after further examination of the patients’ data, the researchers found a link between low vitamin D levels and ""cytokine storms,"" a hyper-inflammatory condition caused by an overactive immune system. (Related: New research suggests vitamin D may help combat coronavirus.)  ""Cytokine storms can severely damage the lungs and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients,"" Ali Daneshkhah, a postdoctoral research associate at Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering, said in a statement.  According to Daneshkhah, this cytokine storm is what seems to kill a majority of COVID-19 patients, and not the destruction of the lungs by the virus itself, as previously believed.  ""It is the complications from the misdirected fire from the immune system,"" Daneshkah, the study’s first author, stated.  This is exactly where vitamin D — an essential nutrient often referred to as the ""sunshine vitamin"" because it is produced by the body as a response to sun exposure — plays a major role.  According to Backman, not only does vitamin D enhance the immune system, but it also keeps it from becoming overactive, adding that having healthy levels of vitamin D could protect patients against COVID-19’s more severe complications — including death.  Despite their findings, the research team does not recommend the immediate hoarding of vitamin D supplements on the market — not even to those who are at risk of deficiency.  ""While I think it is important for people to know that vitamin D deficiency might play a role in mortality, we don’t need to push vitamin D on everybody,"" Backman said, noting that the results of their research still need to be studied more thoroughly.  ""This needs further study, and I hope our work will stimulate interest in this area. The data also may illuminate the mechanism of mortality, which, if proven, could lead to new therapeutic targets,"" Backman said.  ""It is hard to say which dose is most beneficial for COVID-19,"" he added. ""However, it is clear that vitamin D deficiency is harmful, and it can be easily addressed with appropriate supplementation. This might be another key to helping protect vulnerable populations, such as African-American and elderly patients, who have a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.""  As of this writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected over 3.9 million people and killed 270,720 around the world."
Propaganda,"On Friday, local authorities in Germany said that they would reimpose lockdown measures after seeing new clusters of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections around the country. The new lockdowns come just days after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a gradual reopening of the country.  The reimposition of lockdown restrictions marks the country’s first setback since Merkel announced on Wednesday that Germany’s slowing infection rate and relatively low mortality rate meant that the country could cautiously return to normal.  Germany’s reopening plan Germany has reported more than 170,000 cases, according to data gathered by Johns Hopkins University, as of press time. However, its death rate has been lower than that of similarly hit countries, with around 7,000 deaths reported. This led the country’s leaders to believe that they could slowly begin to lift restrictions.  ""We have a very, very good development of the figures for new infections, and that makes it possible for us to take further steps,"" said Merkel when she announced the country’s gradual reopening.  Germany’s leadership had been faced with mounting pressure from businesses demanding a return to normality. However, Merkel made it clear that there would be conditions attached to the latest decision, and that both officials and citizens alike will need to act responsibly.  ""We must take care that things don’t slip out of our hands, and I have a good feeling because we agreed on this emergency mechanism today,"" she said. ""We are not just saying what we are opening, but also that if something happens locally we won’t wait until it has spread through the whole republic.""  State authorities have the final say Under Germany’s federal system, state authorities are responsible for loosening or reimposing lockdown measures. This has led to significant variations in how restrictions have been implemented, with some states being stricter than others.  With the new reopening plan, regional authorities agreed to reimpose measures for any county that reports 50 new cases for every 100,000 people within a week. Those restrictions can be applied either to a facility – such as a nursing home or factory – if the outbreak is concentrated there, or to a whole area.  The aim, according to Merkel, is to avoid having to reimpose a nationwide shutdown.  Clusters of cases in German states In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, the regional government said that there had been an increase in cases at a slaughterhouse in the district of Coesfeld. A total of 150 among the facility’s 1,200 employees tested positive for the virus. According to local officials, the outbreak meant that the district would have to delay the state’s planned May 11 reopening of restaurants, tourist spots, fitness clubs and larger shops by one week. Citizens would also have to continue social distancing. (Related: Almost 900 workers test positive for coronavirus at Tyson’s meatpacking plant in Indiana.)  Karl-Josef Laumann, North Rhine-Westphalia’s health minister, confirmed that the threshold for reimposing restrictions had been breached in Coesfeld. He stated that the slaughterhouse cluster pushed the infection rate up to 61 infections per 100,000 residents.  Laumann has since ordered the temporary closure of the slaughterhouse and said that employees at all of the state’s meat processing plants would now undergo testing for COVID-19.  The northern state of Schleswig-Holstein also saw a similar slaughterhouse outbreak of the coronavirus. This outbreak pushed the district of Steinburg over the threshold. However, it was not immediately clear what action local authorities would take.  Meanwhile, the eastern state of Thuringia recorded more than 80 infections per 100,000 people in the district of Griez over the past week. The cases centered mainly around residents and employees of six care homes and a geriatrics hospital.  The Thuringian government will be holding crisis talks early next week to figure out how to proceed with the planned loosening of stay-at-home measures in the hotspot.  ""To be clear: We’re not going to put the entire district in quarantine,"" said Martina Schweinsburg, Greiz’s chief administrator. She further stressed that just two small towns were particularly affected."
Propaganda,"The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for the coronavirus is currently tracking at over 18% for France, over 16% for Belgium, 14% for Italy, nearly 12% for Spain, 10% for Mexico, about 7% for Canada and is currently at 6% for the USA, according to a comprehensive chart offered by OurWorldInData.org.  The chart, shown below, reveals how the coronavirus is orders of magnitude more deadly than the regular flu, which has a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) below 0.1%, meaning fewer than 1 in 1,000 people who are confirmed and diagnosed with the regular flu end up dying from it. This is confirmed by CDC statistics.  DEFINITIONS: The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is the ratio of deaths to the number of people who are symptomatic and diagnosed with the illness. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) is the ratio of deaths to the number of people who have been infected, even if they never showed symptoms. The IFR for the coronavirus is unreliable because of all the false positives stemming from faulty antibody test kits manufactured in China, which are almost certainly intentionally designed to show high numbers of false positives in order to sow confusion and complacency across America. (Remember: We’re in an actual war with China, and they launched the bioweapon against us. Why wouldn’t they also try to confuse America with bad testing kits, too?)  The pro-Trump media has consistently tried to conflate the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of the coronavirus with the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of the regular flu, to try to dishonestly claim that ""the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu."" Such claims are either the result of 1) Intellectually dishonest people who are trying to downplay the coronavirus for political reasons, or 2) Mathematically illiterate people who don’t know how fractions work.  At Natural News, we have consistently and repeatedly warned that the coronavirus is far more dangerous than the regular flu, and we’ve warned about the complacency being pushed by conservative and independent media, which will result in a second wave of exploding coronavirus cases across the USA. Our warnings have been drowned out by mathematically illiterate (or intellectually dishonest) ""journalists"" who are mostly pro-Trump, conservative pundits who are right now inadvertently setting up President Trump to be utterly destroyed by the second wave of infections and deaths that are coming.  Here’s the current tracking of Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of the coronavirus. Note that these numbers are all low because they assume every person confirmed to have the coronavirus is symptomatic, which isn’t the case at all. In reality, for an accurate CFR analysis, we would have to multiply all the numbers shown here by a factor of something in the neighborhood of 1.4. Note that the horizontal axis on this chart is logarithmic. If you’re not sure what logarithmic means, Fox News has a job opening for you in their science news division.    Source: OurWorldInData.org.  If the Case Fatality Rate for the regular flu were to be depicted on this chart, it would be shown almost touching the bottom line of the chart, at just 0.096% (not even 0.1%, but lower).  Thus, even based on the numbers shown here, the CFR of the coronavirus is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the reagular flu for many countries, including Spain, Italy, France, Hungary, Mexico, etc.  The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for the coronavirus is entirely unknown because of the problem of huge numbers of false positives from bogus antibody test kits. But the IFR for the regular flu is 0.025%, or about 1 in 4,000 people dying after getting infected.  We don’t trust ""infection"" numbers for the coronavirus because there are way too many false positives from the bad testing kits that were all approved by the FDA in a mad rush, even when most of them were so bad they would flag false positives from testing papayas and other fresh fruit.  Global analysis of excess mortalities shows that coronavirus deaths are being significantly under-counted The fact that global coronavirus deaths have been under counted by a substantial amount — as detailed in an exhaustive Financial Times review of excess mortalities — indicates the real death toll from covid-19 is at least 50% higher than official numbers (and may be up to 60% higher).  This the 6% Case Fatality Rate for the coronavirus in the United States is really more like 9-10%. The following FT chart shows the excess deaths from any cause for NYC. Note that it’s a nearly 300% increase in deaths from any cause, regardless of what’s shown on death certificates. This obliterated the denialism argument that claims nobody is really dying from the coronavirus, and that it’s all just people who would have died anyway:    We’ve separately analyzed the numbers over the last several months, confirming that the real CFR for the coronavirus in the United States really is closer to 10%, which means that 1 in 10 people who are diagnosed and symptomatic end up dying from the infection.  The upshot of all this is that as US states begin to reopen their economies and the American masses who have been lied to by Fox News, conservative media and pro-Trump independent media begin to spill into the restaurants, stores and barber shops, a second wave of infections and deaths will once again resume. And the results will be catastrophic for the simple reason that this isn’t just the flu, and it never was.  We’ve detailed the expected progression in this article covering the ""10 Stage of Coronavirus."""
Propaganda,"When you see coronavirus cases trending downward in the U.S., it might seem like good news – until you realize that’s only part of the story. While declines in New York, with its huge population, are indeed helping the overall number drop, it’s obscuring the fact that infections are actually rising in many areas across the country.  New York City was hit hard and early by the virus, but new hotspots are now emerging. Several states are seeing surges in cases right now, even as many states continue lifting lockdowns. Nebraska, for example, is not under a stay-at-home order, and infections there have risen dramatically throughout the course of the pandemic. In just one week, the state saw a 57 percent jump in cases.  In Minnesota, infections have been rising as well. In fact, there has been a 155 percent rise in new infections in just a week. In Kansas, the Topeka area noted a doubling of cases over the week before right as businesses started easing restrictions.  In Iowa, which already counts more than 10,000 cases, deaths recently reached a new daily high as cases rose by 42 percent. More than 1,000 workers at one Tyson Foods pork plant in Waterloo tested positive for the virus, amounting to roughly 37 percent the plant’s overall employees. Virginia’s cases, meanwhile, have risen 31 percent to exceed 20,000. Overall, more than a third of states are seeing rises in infections.  And while it’s excellent news to see a 38 percent drop in new infections in New York, the sheer volume of cases involved is making the upward trend in other places hard to see. With 20 million people, New York has seen more than 321,000 cases and nearly 20,000 deaths.  When you look at the five-day rolling average for new cases across the country during the three weeks that began on April 13, the figure dropped from 9.3 to 8.6 per 100,000 people. However, when you take New York out of the analysis, the rate of new cases has actually risen across the country during that period, growing from 6.2 to 7.5 per 100,000 people.  And while it can be argued that greater testing in the U.S. may be contributing to the higher rate of confirmed cases, it doesn’t account for the whole increase. University of California at Los Angeles Public Health Researcher Dr. Zuo-Feng Zhang said: ""The increase is not because of testing. It’s a real increase.""  Model shows just how bad the situation could become in the U.S. A model from the University of Pennsylvania showed there could be as many as 350,000 people infected with COVID-19 before June ends if every state lifts its stay-at-home orders and allows restaurants and businesses to reopen. Should people maintain social distancing and stick to partial reopenings, they predict nearly 160,000 deaths. Even in the model’s best-case scenario, deaths could reach 115,000 in the next two months.  When it comes to cases by the end of June, the model predicted 7.7 million infections if all states reopen, 3.2 million cases should states stick to a partial reopening, and 2.2 million cases if the types of lockdowns we’re seeing now continue.  In terms of the economy, the model is forecasting a loss of 18.6 million jobs by the end of June, along with an 11.6 percent drop in GDP compared to last year if strict lockdowns stay in place; a partial reopening would see 11.3 million job losses and a 10.7 percent GDP drop. Should all states completely reopen, 500,000 jobs could still be lost, and we could see a 10.1 drop in GDP.  It’s important not to gain a false sense of confidence when we see an overall downward trend in cases. When it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, the figures don’t always tell the whole story."
Propaganda,"The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) revealed Thursday that China was the source of the faulty coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits received by Tanzania. Prior to this, the origin of the test kits — which produced positive results when using samples from a goat and a pawpaw fruit — was unknown.  President John Magufuli ordered an investigation into the imported test kits Sunday. He stated that Tanzanian security forces randomly obtained non-human samples, including ones from pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, in order to evaluate the quality of the kits. These samples were then assigned human names and sent to a laboratory to test for the coronavirus.  Both the kits from the pawpaw and goat tested positive for COVID-19, according to Magufuli. The lab technicians handling the tests were deliberately not informed about the origins of the samples. Based on the results, Magufuli stated that faulty kits meant were marking some people as positive for the coronavirus even though they were not actually infected.  Africa CDC confirms China as the source of faulty kits Dr. John Nkengasong, head of the Africa CDC, responded to the investigation Thursday. He said that the faulty test kits in question were imported to Africa from China, and then sent to Tanzania by the Africa CDC. These kits were donated by China through the Jack Ma Foundation, a charitable organization founded by billionaire Jack Ma.  Ma, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group and member of the Communist Party of China, has donated thousands of test kits, masks and protective gear to Africa, where the equipment is being used in nations across the continent. Aside from Tanzania, no other African countries have voiced any complaints about the test kits. (Related: Israel’s Health Ministry bans the use of Chinese coronavirus test kits,)  Nkengasong also commented on Magufuli’s allegation that the Africa CDC sent defective kits to Tanzania.  ""We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries, and providing them with test kits,"" stated the Africa CDC chief. ""We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.""  Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, head of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Africa office, also reacted to Tanzania’s investigation of the test kits.  ""We are convinced that the tests that have been provided … both through procurement through [WHO’s Africa office] and those that came through Jack Ma donations, were not contaminated with the virus,"" Moeti said in a teleconference with journalists on Thursday.  Testing lab under investigation Tanzania’s government has formed a team of experts to examine the lab that conducted the tests, stated chief government spokesman Hassan Abbas, and it would relay the outcome of the investigation, once results were in.  ""What the president said was based on initial tests run by using animals … to test the veracity of the test results,"" said Abbas. ""Our worry was based on empirical findings. Once the team finalizes its work we will know the gravity of the lapses in the machines.""  Test issues could affect Africa’s efforts to fight COVID-19 If the veracity of Tanzania’s test on the kits is demonstrated, and the test kits or machines proved to be faulty, it’ll be a huge blow to testing efforts in Africa. While the continent’s testing capacity has expanded sharply, Africa has still only carried out around 685 tests per million people, according to Reuters. In comparison, Europe has carried out nearly 17 million tests, or just under 23,000 per million.  The WHO has warned that there could be as many as 10 million infections in the continent within the next six months. Additionally, Moeti has warned that the disease could ""smoulder"" in the region, becoming a fixture in the lives of Africans for years to come unless governments take a more proactive approach.  ""While COVID-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will [smolder] in transmission hotspots,"" said Moeti. ""COVID-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.""  As of press time, Tanzania has 509 cases of the coronavirus and 21 death, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."
Propaganda,"The Trump administration sure isn’t letting a good crisis go to waste as it publicly announces the reopening of society and the economy – under a few conditions, of course: There will need to be mass ""surveillance, testing, and contact tracing"" of Americans in order to proceed.  Speaking to Breitbart News, Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health (ASH), admitted during a recent interview that the federal government is currently developing a massive authoritarian response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that will forever change the way Americans live their lives. Part of this response is to implement a full-scale police state and control grid to supposedly keep tabs on those infected with the novel virus.  A four-star admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (USPHS), the federal uniformed service of the Public Health Service (PHS), Giroir is a top adviser to the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). He’s also a key member of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, serving as its ""testing czar.""  As the testing czar, Giroir has been tasked with heading up the logistics of ramping up efforts by the United States to test more people for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). Since he came on board a few weeks ago, testing capacity has increased from about 100,000 to more than three million, for which he is very proud.  There are ""over three million (tests) as of today,"" Giroir told Breitbart News. ""In the places where there’s a lot of disease like New York and Washington, we far exceed South Korea … We have the most testing per capita of any place in the world.""  Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reveals the Big Pharma plot to enslave humanity by exploiting the coronavirus crisis:       ""Tens of millions"" of people per month will be finger pricked for coronavirus This testing, we’re now learning, is also being expanded in terms of how it’s going to take place. Part of the reopening of America, which is being headed up by Jared Kushner and Trump’s daughter Ivanka, will involve instituting ""wide-scale serological testing,"" which is different from the kind that’s been utilized up until this point.  As Giroir explained during the interview, most of the testing that’s already been done for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) involved looking for the virus in people’s noses, which means they’re actively infected with it. Now, the government will be looking for antibodies to see if people previously had the virus and are now recovered with immunity.  ""The antibody test will get us an idea of if you have been infected in the past and are presumably – not 100 percent certain but probably, by all known medical computation – that you would be immune to getting the virus again at least in the intermediate term,"" he says.  ""It is an important component, but it is not really the whole foundation of where we’re going.""  And just where are they going, you might be asking? The federal government is planning to unveil a finger prick test that will look at people’s blood and determine whether or not they’ve had the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), recovered from it, and developed immunity, all based on the presence of antibodies.  Dr. Deborah Birx, who’s coordinating the White House’s Coronavirus Task Force, is the one who will determine the distribution of these tests, which will be conducted in places like pharmacies and doctor’s offices. And according to Giroir, they will be conducted ""in the tens of millions per month."""
Propaganda,"One of the first states to reopen, at least partially, amid the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is Texas, the governor of which announced at the turn of the month that restaurants, malls, movie theaters and a handful of other select businesses would be allowed to resume operations. But some of them are doing so with a catch: Customers will have to first pass through ""airport security-style"" checkpoints in order to enter.  EVO Entertainment CEO Mitchell Roberts told the media that he decided to reopen his chain of movie theaters using similar screening methods as the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in order to earn back the confidence of his customer base, even though Texas Governor Greg Abbott is not requiring this.  Reports indicate that all EVO movie theaters throughout the Lone Star State will require that guests enter through a special cordoned area where they will be asked by employees whether anyone in their households has had flu symptoms in the past two weeks. Guests will also be subject to an infrared temperature screening, and anyone who clocks in at 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher will be told to leave the premises.  Gov. Abbott’s executive order, on the other hand, which he signed on April 28, encourages businesses to merely follow the ""minimum standard health protocols"" recommended by the state’s health department. These include so-called ""social distancing"" as well as ""appropriate face coverings,"" though ""no jurisdiction can impose a civil or criminal penalty for failure to wear a face covering,"" it clearly adds.  As for movie theaters like those owned by EVO, the only other requirement is that they ""operate at up to 25 percent of the total listed occupancy of any individual theater for any screening."" If Texas sees at least two weeks of data showing no additional Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) flare-ups, then capacity will be increased to 50 percent.  However, nothing is stated in the EO about airport-style security protocols, which EVO appears to be implementing of its own volition. It remains to be seen whether EVO customers will agree to comply with these draconian measures or simply stay home until they are lifted.  Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, declares that the time is now to end the lockdowns and initiate the takedowns:    Most Texans are voluntarily avoiding movie theaters for at least the next several weeks It could be that none of this really matters anyway seeing as how a Kickstand Communications poll found that most Texans are not exactly keen on going to the movies anytime soon.  A mere 10 percent of Austin residents indicated that they plan to immediately return to movie theaters and malls, while just over 60 percent stated they would probably go back within the month. Similarly, only about 15 percent are willing to immediately return to retails stores, while 87 percent said they plan to get back to shopping later in May.  ""We do not take these responsibilities lightly,"" added the CEO of Santikos Entertainment, a San Antonio-based movie theater chain that is also implementing airport-style security measures that are similar to those being put in place by EVO.  ""We have been working diligently on safety protocols that will make Santikos a model, not just for theaters but for all businesses on how to open responsibly.""  Santikos is asking all moviegoers if they have been in contact with anyone over the past two weeks who showed symptoms potentially indicative of infection with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).  ""If yes, you will not be allowed in the theater and we will reimburse you your ticket,"" the company’s new guidelines state."
Propaganda,"Because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Americans are now dealing with unemployment and food insecurity. At the same time, businesses are struggling to stay afloat and meet the ever-changing demand of consumers across the country.  Coronavirus and the new normal The pandemic has forced businesses throughout America to adjust to the new normal.  Sherry Bonanno, executive director of the Hollywood Food Coalition, explained that the organization had to adapt their practices to effectively help those in need.  The pandemic has caused significant changes in California, where over one-third of America’s vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown. Adding to the pandemic is the state’s currently existing issues of hunger and homelessness.  To address these concerns, food producers, distributors, retailers and advocates are continuously trying to come up with new ways to sustain the nation’s food supply and their own bottom lines, at the same time minimizing food waste and want.  Farmers and wasted produce On March 16, Gov. Gavin Newsom implored restaurants to close. This then resulted in huge losses for the foodservice industry that supplied restaurants and bars, along with schools, hotels, production studios and catering services.  While worried consumers rushed to grocery stores to stockpile food and retail demand skyrocketed, the business wasn’t enough to meet all the lost demand from restaurants.  Scott Grabau, president and chief executive of Tanimura & Antle, a Salinas-based lettuce producer, said that the pandemic has flipped his business upside-down.  Tanimura & Antle grows year-round in California and Arizona but has recently had to stop harvesting entire fields. Grabau is considering planting more iceberg and romaine lettuce, two vegetables that are more popular among shoppers, and less of the boutique leaves offered to chefs.  Meanwhile, Cathy Burns, CEO of the Produce Marketing Association that represents produce companies, explained that crops planted months before based on pre-pandemic demand went to waste because of a lack of buyers. Produce worth billions of dollars had to be tilled back into the soil.  To reduce food waste in your own kitchen, categorize vegetables into groups: Use now, later and latest. Store hardier ingredients towards the back of the fridge and more fragile ingredients near the front.  If you have enough vegetables for at least one week, you can manage the ingredients better. Pay attention to each vegetable’s ""internal clock,"" so you can cook with them before they go bad.  Truckers with uncertain futures According to Zach England, the chief operating officer of C.R. England, a Utah-based company that transports produce and meat in refrigerated trucks throughout California and other states, his company experienced the pandemic’s ""seesaw effect.""  At least 4,000 of England’s 6,000 drivers haul food routinely. The demand for their services skyrocketed during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic when grocers had to work double-time to restock shelves, but the demand has settled down. (Related: Coronavirus infections at meat plants are already leading to grocery shortages.)  Greg Dubuque, president of the California Trucking Association and owner of Liberty Linehaul West in Montebello, shared that trucking companies continue operating in the hopes that the situation will improve soon.  Grocers and employee safety During the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown, shoppers quickly emptied store shelves. Grocers raced to restock, even as inventory was coming in from suppliers. Worried consumers were purchasing four to eight weeks’ worth of food at a time.  These last few weeks, Kroger and other grocers continue to keep stores stocked, even though dozens of workers have become ill. Unions protest that they report are management failures to ensure their workplace safety.  Food banks and hungry citizens The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in the supply of free food to food banks. At the same time, millions of Californians have become unemployed due to the pandemic, with a lot of families going hungry.  During the first three weeks of April, over 265,000 Americans applied for government food assistance under the CalFresh program. The California Department of Social Services, which administers the program, reported that the figure is more than twice the number of applicants during the same period in 2019.  On the other hand, grocery stores are selling more of their stock and donating less food. While restaurants and other businesses that closed had lots of supplies to give to food banks when the shutdown first began, the supply has now petered out.  Advocates work twice as hard to keep food banks operating Bonanno from the Hollywood Food Coalition is constantly working on a new model that will allow clients to receive their food outside in a to-go bag.  Bonanno is also at a loss since her normal supply chains were cleaned out. Pre-coronavirus times, her group often received food from the movie studios, where one day of production on a film or television set results in enough leftover meals for hundreds of people.  But now, all the studios have closed and caterers, restaurants and groceries are providing the Hollywood Food Coalition with fewer resources.  Hope for the future Throughout the American food system, citizens from all walks of life have expressed their fears and concerns. Despite this great need, experts remain hopeful about reducing food waste.  Chris Tang, a supply chain expert and professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, noted that countries and organizations around the globe are trying to think of efficient ways to ""rebalance the supply and demand."" Tang added that efforts must be made to prevent food waste and get the food to those in need.  Currently, producers and those on the front lines of poverty and hunger are collaborating to address this issue. Tang expressed hope that the government and the private sector will work harder to connect the two.  He suggested that California, which has tech hubs and plenty of farms, could pave the way for possible solutions. With a new, nationwide online platform, there’s a chance that those who have access to food can quickly offer aid to those in need."
Propaganda,"For months, the establishment has been dishing out a narrative claiming that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a natural, albeit mysterious and unexplained, phenomenon that probably originated at a Chinese meat market. But contrary evidence continues to surface suggesting that the virus actually originated inside a Chinese laboratory and research center.  Many virologists continue to deny this, of course, claiming that there is no evidence to support the notion that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) might in any way be unnatural. But the genetic hallmarks they are looking for as proof may not be as evident as previously believed because modern genetic engineering can be done without leaving a trace.  Believe it or not, a Swiss research team was able to create a synthetic clone of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) in less than a month. And they did this by inserting genetic fragments in such a way that, unless a scientist knows exactly what to look for, would not necessarily be apparent.  Over the past 15-20 years, researchers have been actively studying, dissecting, reconstructing and otherwise tampering with coronaviruses of various types. This includes the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which one scientific researcher describes as an ""obvious chimera,"" meaning it is a combination of at least two pre-existing viruses.  This scientist, who goes by the name of Yuri Deigin and edits the Open Longevity journal both in Russian and English, says that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is based on an ancestral bat strain of coronavirus known as RaTG13, but with a replaced receptor binding motif (RBM) in its spike protein.  The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) also contains an added stretch of four different amino acids that he says were inserted into the virus, creating a furin cleavage site ""that, as virologists have previously established, significantly expands the ‘repertoire’ of the virus in terms of whose cells it can penetrate.""  Because of this, Deigin speculates, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was probably able to mutate and jump species, leaving its original host and infecting humans. And it just so happens that this very type of research was taking place at the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China, which is where the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) originated.  Virologists like Shi Zhengli, Deigin points out, have ""done many similar things in the past,"" including replacing the RBM in one type of virus with the RBM of another. They have also added new furin sites to coronaviruses, creating new artificial species-specific coronaviruses that borrow from other coronaviruses in their ability to do new things.  Now this does not necessarily mean that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was an intentional bioweapon, at least in Deigin’s view. It could be that it was an experiment gone wrong rather than an intentional effort at plunging the entire world into a pandemic. At the same time, it does seem clear that the virus did, in fact, come from a lab, and probably from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Teams led by Shi Zhengli have created at least eight artificial chimeric coronaviruses over the years, and received money from NIH Deigin uncovered that between the years of 2007 and 2017, Shi Zhengli and colleagues created at least eight new chimeric coronaviruses with a variety of RBMs. And in 2019, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) actually gave the Wuhan Institute of Virology $3.7 million as part of a grant entitled, Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence.  That same year, Shi Zhengli co-authored a paper calling for continued research into these and other synthetic viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, arguing that there are ""no clinical treatments or prevention strategies"" currently available with regard to human coronaviruses.  All of this is highly suspicious, seeing as how 2019 was the very same year that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) first emerged in China, and in the same city where Shi Zhengli and colleagues were working on similar coronaviruses. There is little doubt that this chimeric virus originated in that lab, despite continued denial by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  But it no longer matters what the CCP claims as people all over the world are figuring out the truth on their own. It is at least apparent that something went amiss with the containment of this virus, and it is possible that whatever happened was intentional.  Deigin lays out the details from Shi Zhengli’s 2019 paper about the relative ease with which even a graduate student in the field could create such a virus. He also spells out the detailed biology of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) as evidence that it definitely matches the type of thing that Shi Zhengli describes.  Based on the evidence he puts forth, which you can peruse in its entirety at this link, the only logical conclusion is that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is genetically modified and came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He also traces the origins of the RaTG13 strain from which the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was derived.  Amazingly, Shi Zhengli admitted just this year that she was the one who isolated RaTG13 back in 2013 from Yunnan horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus affinis variety. None of this was known, however, until January 2020 when the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) first started arriving in the U.S.  All of this absolutely implicates communist China in the unleashing of this global pandemic, not to mention the NIH that helped to fund this type of research. Heads need to roll, and those who have been victimized by this thing – including everyone who has been forced into lockdown – deserves a full measure of justice.  Bioweapon or not, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a product of China, as well as a product of our own federal government. And both entities need to be held accountable for the roles they played in scourging the planet with this invisible beast.  On the other hand, if it was all just an accident as Deigin believes was probably the case, then those involved need to fess up and admit their error rather than continue to claim that this is all just some wild conspiracy theory."
